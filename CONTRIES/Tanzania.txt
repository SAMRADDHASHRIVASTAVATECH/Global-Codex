Approaching General Elections (October 2025): Tanzania is in a critical pre-election period leading up to the general elections in October 2025. President Samia Suluhu Hassan officially dissolved Parliament on June 27, 2025, marking the end of the current government's term. The upcoming election is being closely watched, particularly after a judiciary ruling in April 2025 barred the main opposition party, CHADEMA, from participating in the general election due to a "procedural failure to sign a code of conduct." This has raised significant concerns about political competition and the fairness of the electoral process, with some analysts describing it as a "quiet collapse of political competition" and a move towards "managed democracy."

"4Rs" Agenda and Governance Reforms: President Samia Suluhu Hassan's political philosophy is summarized by the "4Rs": Reconciliation, Resilience, Reforms, and Rebuilding. These principles guide the government's agenda, with notable improvements in its ranking on the Chandler Good Government Index. Reforms include enhanced government effectiveness through increased adoption of new policy solutions and digital governance initiatives.

International Scrutiny and Human Rights Concerns: The pre-election environment has drawn international attention. UN human rights experts expressed alarm in June 2025 over a "pattern of enforced disappearance and torture" used to silence opposition and critics, citing the arbitrary arrest, torture, and enforced disappearance of two human rights defenders/journalists in May 2025. A delegation from the African Union conducted a pre-election assessment mission in June 2025 to evaluate preparedness, assess women's political participation, and examine the political context.

Regional Integration and Foreign Relations: Tanzania continues to strengthen its strategic ties with countries such as Egypt, France, and TÃ¼rkiye, boosting international confidence and attracting foreign direct investments. As a member of the East African Community (EAC), Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), Tanzania leverages its position for regional trade and economic integration, providing access to a combined market of 1.3 billion people.

Economic Outlook

Robust Growth Trajectory: Tanzania's economy is experiencing robust growth. The IMF, in June 2025, projected real GDP growth to reach 6.0% in calendar year 2025, up from 5.5% in 2024, with a medium-term outlook of 6.5% contingent on sustained reform implementation. Other forecasts also point to strong momentum, with some predicting 6.1% growth in 2025.

Subdued Inflation: Headline inflation has remained stable and subdued, standing at 3.2% year-on-year in April 2025, which is below the central bank's target of 5%. This stability contributes to consumer purchasing power and business planning.

Fiscal Consolidation and Tax Reforms: The government is committed to growth-friendly fiscal consolidation in FY25/26. The 2025/26 budget, effective from July 1, 2025, introduces significant tax reforms aimed at building a fairer and more inclusive tax system, broadening the tax base (especially in the digital sector), and emphasizing self-reliance. Measures include increasing the alternative minimum tax for companies, introducing a withholding tax on retained earnings not distributed, and extending VAT to online marketing platforms and non-resident online payment service providers.

IMF Support and Structural Reforms: The IMF has approved a significant disbursement of $448.4 million to Tanzania in June 2025, following the completion of reviews under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). This recognizes Tanzania's economic improvements and ongoing structural reforms. Key areas for continued reform include improving tax administration efficiency, easing regulatory burdens, promoting access to finance, closing gender gaps, and upgrading infrastructure.

Sectoral Performance and Investment: Key sectors driving growth include ICT and digital economy (projected 12.5% growth in 2025), energy (11.0%), mining (8.6%), and manufacturing (5.0%). Agriculture, while steady, needs modernization. Tourism is on the rebound. Tanzania aims to attract $15 billion in investments in 2025, focusing on manufacturing, clean energy, transport, minerals, and agriculture. Notably, the Julius Nyerere Hydropower Station is expected to be completed in 2025, significantly addressing electricity supply challenges.

Public Administration

Digital Governance Initiatives: Tanzania has significantly expanded digital governance initiatives to improve administrative efficiency and service delivery. The Digital Tanzania Project is laying a foundation for technology-driven governance solutions, including a new integrated government performance system that will serve as a digital dashboard with public input. Services like passport issuance have seen dramatic improvements in efficiency.

Judiciary Strengthening: There has been a notable emphasis on strengthening the judiciary through investment in training and development for judges and court staff, particularly in commercial law, environmental law, and human rights. Digital case management systems have been introduced to reduce case backlogs and enhance accountability.

Land Reforms: Land law reforms have been implemented to address disputes, especially in rural areas, and to improve property rights, including for women in marginalized groups. A Presidential committee was inaugurated in February 2025 to evaluate land issues in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area.

Fiscal Management and Accountability: The government is committed to prudent budget execution, particularly in the election year, and strengthening public financial and investment management. Efforts are also being made to reduce domestic arrears.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Civil Law System: Tanzania operates under a civil law system.

Human Rights Concerns and Electoral Context: The pre-election period has seen escalating human rights concerns. UN human rights experts, in June 2025, highlighted a "pattern of repression" involving enforced disappearance and torture of political opponents, human rights defenders, and journalists. The disqualification of the main opposition party (CHADEMA) from the October 2025 elections by a judiciary ruling has raised questions about institutional neutrality and the use of legal procedures to undermine political pluralism.

Judicial Reforms and Accountability: Despite concerns, the government has emphasized strengthening the judiciary, investing in training, and implementing digital case management systems to improve efficiency and accountability. However, the Human Rights Report 2024 (published November 2024) noted ongoing concerns about violations of the rights of accused persons, including arbitrary arrest and detention.

Legislation and Initiatives: The adoption of the National Plan of Action on the Rights and Welfare of Persons with Albinism (2024/2025-2028/2029) and the amendment of the Law of the Child Act to establish children's councils indicate efforts to enhance specific protections. The drafting of a National Plan of Action on Business and Human Rights is also underway.

African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights: The African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (AfCHPR), headquartered in Arusha, Tanzania, successfully marked the opening of its 2025 Judicial Year in February, focusing on "Advancing Justice through Reparations." The court continues to hear cases concerning human rights across the continent.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Diverse Religious Landscape: Tanzania has a diverse religious landscape, with significant populations of Christians (both Catholic and Protestant), Muslims, and followers of traditional African religions. Zanzibar, in particular, has a predominantly Muslim population.

Religious Harmony and Dialogue: Generally, Tanzania is known for its relatively peaceful coexistence among different religious groups, although occasional tensions can arise. The government's emphasis on reconciliation within its "4Rs" agenda extends to promoting inter-religious harmony.

Gender Studies

Women's Political Participation: The African Union pre-election assessment mission in June 2025 specifically aimed to assess and encourage women's political participation, both as voters and candidates, in the upcoming October elections. This highlights ongoing efforts to improve gender representation in leadership.

Vulnerability to Violence: The UN experts' report in June 2025 noted the "gendered nature of reprisals faced by women journalists and human rights defenders," with reports of sexual assault, underscoring the continued vulnerability of women to violence, particularly in politically charged environments.

Economic Empowerment: The government has re-introduced 10% council loans for women, youth, and persons with disabilities, aiming to promote economic empowerment. Reforms to land laws also specifically aim to improve property rights for women in marginalized groups.

Closing Gender Gaps: The IMF's recent assessment highlighted the importance of accelerating structural reforms to close gender gaps and promote sustainable private-sector-led growth.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Over 120 Tribes and Kiswahili Unity: Tanzania is home to over 120 ethnic groups, making it one of the most ethnically diverse countries in Africa. Despite this diversity, there is a strong sense of national unity, largely fostered by Kiswahili as the common national language.

Cultural Preservation and Identity: The country maintains a rich cultural heritage, with various traditions, languages, and artistic expressions. Efforts are made to preserve and promote this diversity while reinforcing a shared Tanzanian identity.

Social Cohesion and Challenges: While there is a culture of mutual respect, socio-economic disparities and political tensions can strain social cohesion. The government's focus on inclusive development, addressing poverty, and improving basic services is crucial for strengthening social fabric.

Youth Unemployment: Economic diversification and job creation, particularly for the youth, remain significant issues, with high youth unemployment. Efforts are underway to modernize agriculture and promote industrialization to address this.

Philosophy

Self-Reliance (Ujamaa Legacy): The 2025/26 budget emphasizes "self-reliance," harkening back to the foundational philosophy of Ujamaa (African Socialism) under Julius Nyerere. This philosophical stance advocates for reducing dependence on external aid and fostering domestic resource mobilization, particularly in critical areas like energy, water, and healthcare.

Developmentalism and Pragmatism: The current government's approach, framed by the "4Rs," reflects a pragmatic developmentalism, focusing on reforms and rebuilding to achieve economic growth and improve people's welfare. This includes significant investment in infrastructure as a foundation for future development.

Democracy and Human Rights in Question: The pre-election political climate, with the exclusion of major opposition and reports of repression, raises fundamental philosophical questions about the nature of democracy in Tanzania: whether it is a genuinely competitive system or a "managed democracy" where legality is used to entrench incumbency, as observed by some analysts. The ongoing human rights concerns challenge the ethical foundations of governance.

History

Ancient History and Trade: Tanzania has a long history, including being part of ancient trade routes, particularly along the Swahili coast, which saw influences from Arab, Persian, and Indian traders.

Colonial Rule: It experienced German colonial rule (German East Africa) and later British rule after World War I, with Tanganyika becoming a British mandate. Zanzibar was a separate British protectorate.

Independence (1961/1963) and Union (1964): Tanganyika gained independence in 1961, and Zanzibar in 1963. In 1964, Tanganyika and Zanzibar united to form the United Republic of Tanzania.

Ujamaa and Julius Nyerere: Under its first president, Julius Nyerere, Tanzania adopted the policy of Ujamaa, focusing on self-reliance and socialist development.

Multi-Party System and Liberalization: In the 1990s, Tanzania transitioned to a multi-party political system and embarked on economic liberalization.

Recent Political Developments (2025): The period leading up to the October 2025 general elections is a significant historical moment, with concerns about the state of democracy and human rights amid the disqualification of the main opposition party.

Social Work

Poverty Reduction: Despite economic progress, poverty rates remain above 25%, making poverty reduction a key area for social work intervention. The budget emphasizes inclusive development, particularly in agriculture, to directly address rural poverty.

Addressing Vulnerabilities: Social workers play a vital role in addressing vulnerabilities such as violence against women and children, including intimate partner violence and sexual violence. They also assist persons with albinism (PWAs), who have faced renewed attacks.

Community Development: Grassroots formations and cooperatives are emerging to address economic disparities, particularly among smallholder farmers and informal workers, providing avenues for community-based social work.

Psychosocial Support: Given the political repression and human rights concerns, social workers are crucial in providing gender-sensitive medical, psychological, and legal support services to survivors of torture and sexual violence.

Youth Engagement: With high youth unemployment, social work programs supporting youth participation in decision-making and empowering youth-led political dialogue are critical.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Restricted Media Freedom: Media freedom in Tanzania is facing significant challenges in the pre-election period. UN experts reported in June 2025 on "curtailing press and media freedom" and "intimidating journalists and human rights defenders," with instances of arbitrary arrest and enforced disappearance.

"Manufacturing Consent": Some analysts suggest the state is deploying a strategy of "manufacturing consent through soft power," heavily investing in entertainers, influencers, and state media to craft an image of unity and progress, while sidelining the underprivileged majority.

Digital Rights and Laws: There is a need to repeal restrictive online content laws and safeguard digital freedoms to create safe spaces for civic engagement.

Role in Public Information: Despite the restrictions, the media plays a crucial role in informing citizens about government policies, such as the Annual Water Sector Status Report, promoting transparency and dialogue.

Education / Teaching

Investment in Education: The 2025/26 budget includes increased public spending on education, aligning with the long-term vision to accelerate human capital development for a young and rapidly growing population.

Curriculum Modernization: While significant investment has gone into building classrooms, there's a recognized need for teachers and curriculum to "keep up with the 21st century," including embracing technology.

Civic Education: A recommendation by analysts is to reintroduce civic education in schools to enhance youth participation and democratic understanding.

Vocational Training: Efforts are being made to strengthen vocational adult education to address skill gaps and support individuals detached from the labor market.

Library Science

Cultural Heritage Preservation: Libraries and archives are crucial for preserving Tanzania's rich and diverse cultural heritage, including its linguistic diversity, oral traditions, and historical records.

Access to Information: They serve as vital centers for providing public access to information, supporting literacy, and fostering continuous learning, especially as the country pushes for digitalization and inclusive development.

Digital Transformation Support: Libraries can play a role in supporting digital literacy and access to digital resources, aligning with the government's Digital Tanzania Project.

Role in National Development: By providing resources and promoting knowledge, libraries contribute to human capital development, which is a key priority for achieving the goals of Tanzania Vision 2050.
