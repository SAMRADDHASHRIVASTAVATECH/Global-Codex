State of Palestine
Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Recognition and Status: As of July 2025, the State of Palestine is recognized as a sovereign state by 147 of the 193 UN member states (over 75%). It holds non-member observer state status at the United Nations General Assembly since November 2012, with additional rights granted in May 2024 (e.g., seated with member states, right to introduce proposals, participate in committees, but no voting rights).

Fragmented Governance: The Palestinian political landscape remains deeply fragmented. The Palestinian Authority (PA), led by President Mahmoud Abbas (whose term has long expired), nominally governs parts of the West Bank. Hamas maintains de facto control over the Gaza Strip. Efforts to achieve national unity remain stalled amidst the ongoing conflict.

Ongoing Conflict and Displacement: The conflict that escalated in October 2023 continues to devastate Gaza. As of late June 2025, over 56,000 Palestinians have been reported killed in Gaza, with over 130,000 injured. More than 680,000 people have been newly displaced since the January-March 2025 ceasefire agreement ended, with approximately 82% of the Gaza Strip now within Israeli-militarized zones or under displacement orders.

Stalled Peace Process: Negotiations between Israel and Hamas on a new ceasefire remain deadlocked. Hamas insists on a permanent end to the war, while Israel demands disarmament. International efforts, including a proposed high-level conference on a two-state solution, face significant obstacles due to intractable positions and the continued violence.

International Pressure and Declarations: The international community, including the UN, EU, and various individual states (e.g., Spain, France contemplating recognition), continues to call for a ceasefire, adherence to international humanitarian law, and the implementation of a two-state solution. There are increasing calls for accountability for violations of international humanitarian law.

Economic Outlook

Deep Contraction and Crisis: The Palestinian economy, particularly in Gaza, is in a state of severe collapse. GDP is estimated to have shrunk by 27% in 2024, the most severe decline in three decades. The outlook for 2025 remains highly uncertain and fragile, hinging on a sustained ceasefire and effective reconstruction.

Gaza's Economic Devastation: Economic activities in Gaza have largely ceased. The extensive damage to infrastructure (80% of cropland, 83% of agricultural wells inoperative) and commercial blockade have severely constrained food supply, with the entire population of Gaza (approx. 2.1 million) facing "crisis" or worse levels of acute food insecurity. The risk of famine is critical.

West Bank Strain: The West Bank economy has also contracted significantly (28% decline in GDP) due to heightened Israeli movement and trade restrictions, the termination of Palestinian employment in Israel, and Israeli deductions from PA tax revenues, alongside rising settler violence.

Reconstruction Needs: Reconstruction and recovery needs in Gaza are estimated to require $53 billion, a sum that highlights the immense challenges, both economic and political.

Humanitarian-Economic Nexus: The economic crisis directly exacerbates the humanitarian catastrophe, leading to a breakdown of services, hyperinflation in some areas, and widespread food insecurity.

Public Administration

Disjointed Administration: Public administration is highly fragmented, with the Palestinian Authority (PA) governing limited areas of the West Bank and Hamas controlling Gaza. This division severely hinders unified governance and effective service delivery across the Palestinian territories.

Infrastructure Collapse: The conflict has led to the near collapse of public services in Gaza, including water, sanitation, health, and education infrastructure. Lack of fuel, resources, and widespread damage prevent the operation and maintenance of essential services.

Aid Delivery Challenges: Humanitarian aid delivery is severely hampered by security risks, access restrictions, and the absence of a fully functioning, unified administrative structure. New aid delivery mechanisms established by Israel and the US, bypassing the UN and its partners, are viewed as militarized and not adhering to humanitarian principles.

Fiscal Crisis: The PA faces a deepening fiscal crisis, impacting its ability to pay salaries and provide basic services.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Widespread Violations and Impunity: The legal and criminal justice systems are severely undermined by the ongoing conflict and occupation. Reports indicate widespread human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions, torture, ill-treatment, and extrajudicial killings by all parties involved. Impunity for perpetrators is a significant concern.

International Humanitarian Law: There are ongoing accusations of breaches of international humanitarian law (IHL) by various parties, with increasing calls from international bodies for accountability. Reports suggest Israel may be in breach of its human rights obligations under the EU-Israel Association Agreement.

Restrictions on Rights: Fundamental rights, including freedom of movement, expression, and assembly, are severely curtailed, particularly in the West Bank due to Israeli restrictions and in Gaza due to the conflict.

War Crimes Allegations: Various international and Palestinian bodies describe actions in Gaza as potential war crimes, including the targeting of civilians, massacres, and the systematic starvation of the population.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Diverse Religious Landscape: The State of Palestine is predominantly Muslim (Sunni), with a significant Christian minority and a small Samaritan community. Religious sites sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are present.

Religious Freedom under Occupation: Religious freedom for Palestinians is impacted by the conflict and occupation, with restrictions on access to holy sites and freedom of worship.

Impact of Conflict: The conflict has exacerbated religious tensions and had a devastating impact on communities of all faiths, disrupting religious life and access to places of worship.

Gender Studies

Disproportionate Impact on Women and Girls: Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the conflict and humanitarian crisis, facing heightened risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child marriage, and sexual exploitation.

Mass Casualties: The majority of Palestinians reported killed in Gaza since October 2023 are women and children.

Increased Vulnerabilities: The lack of food, water, and cooking energy deepens gender inequality and exacerbates GBV risks. Pregnant women and newborns face severe challenges in accessing healthcare.

Limited Participation: The ongoing conflict and political instability severely limit women's participation in political processes and public life.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Mass Displacement: Over 1.9 million people in Gaza (approx. 90% of the population) have been displaced, many repeatedly (some 10 times or more), leading to severe overcrowding in makeshift shelters and designated displacement sites.

Food Insecurity and Malnutrition: The entire population of Gaza faces severe food insecurity, with acute malnutrition sharply increasing among children aged six to 59 months. An average of 112 children a day were admitted for malnutrition treatment between January and May 2025.

Cultural Trauma and Loss: The scale of destruction has had a devastating impact on the physical and mental well-being of the population. Cultural heritage sites are at risk.

Child Protection Crisis: Children face an extreme protection crisis, including high rates of child separation (17,000 children estimated separated), mental health challenges, and being out of school (660,000 in Gaza).

Threat to Palestinian Identity: Warnings from UN officials about a long-term plan to "erase the Palestinian refugee issue" and "separate Palestinians from Palestine" highlight existential threats to Palestinian identity and the right of return.

Philosophy

Struggle for Self-Determination and Justice: The core philosophical struggle for the Palestinian people is the pursuit of self-determination, an end to occupation, and justice for historical grievances and ongoing human rights violations.

Resilience amidst Catastrophe: Despite immense suffering and displacement, there is a profound resilience within Palestinian society, alongside deep despair and calls for an end to the "spiral of hunger, death and suffering."

Existential Threat: The discourse around the conflict increasingly includes terms like "genocide" and "ethnic cleansing," reflecting a perceived existential threat to the Palestinian people and their presence on their land.

History

Historical Context: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has deep historical roots, including the 1948 Nakba (catastrophe), the 1967 War (leading to the occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem), and decades of Israeli occupation and settlement expansion.

Oslo Accords (1993, 1995): These accords created the Palestinian Authority (PA) as an interim self-governing administration, but negotiations stalled.

Escalation Since October 2023: The current period is defined by the severe escalation of conflict since October 7, 2023, leading to an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.

International Recognition Efforts: Since 2011-2012, Palestine has actively pursued international recognition of its statehood through the UN and other international bodies.

Social Work

Overwhelming Humanitarian Needs: Social workers are at the forefront of responding to the catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with 3.3 million people in the State of Palestine requiring assistance, especially in Gaza where the entire population is in need.

Child Protection and Mental Health: A critical focus is on child protection, addressing child separation, and providing mental health and psychosocial support for children and families traumatized by the conflict.

Access to Basic Services: Social workers are engaged in efforts to provide safe water, sanitation, healthcare, and critical WASH supplies amidst the collapse of infrastructure.

GBV Prevention and Response: Interventions to mitigate and prevent gender-based violence are crucial due to heightened risks.

Challenges: Social workers face extreme operational challenges, including insecurity, restricted access, and severe under-resourcing of humanitarian agencies like UNRWA.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Extremely Dangerous Environment: Journalism in the Palestinian territories, especially Gaza, is extremely dangerous. Journalists are targeted, killed, or injured, and infrastructure supporting media operations is destroyed.

Information Control: All parties involved engage in information control and propaganda. Independent reporting is severely hampered.

Narrative Battle: There is a constant battle over narratives, with official Palestinian sources (e.g., Ministry of Health in Gaza, Palestinian National Council) providing data and perspectives that often differ from Israeli or other international sources.

International Media Focus: International media extensively cover the conflict, though access restrictions and safety concerns limit independent reporting from Gaza.

Education / Teaching

Education System Collapse: The education system, particularly in Gaza, has largely collapsed. Thousands of children are out of school (660,000 in Gaza, 133,000 in West Bank). Schools have been damaged or destroyed.

Impact of Violence: Attacks on education and teacher salary cuts have deepened the crisis, affecting access and quality.

Mental Health Impact: The conflict has a devastating impact on children's mental health, affecting their ability to learn.

UNRWA's Role: UNRWA continues to play a vital role in providing education, but its services are critically under-resourced and hindered by the conflict and funding issues.

Library Science

Cultural Heritage Destruction: Libraries and cultural institutions in Gaza are at severe risk of damage or destruction due to bombardments.

Loss of Access: The collapse of infrastructure and ongoing conflict severely limit access to existing libraries and information resources.

Preservation Challenges: Efforts to preserve Palestinian cultural heritage, including historical documents and literary collections, face immense challenges amidst the ongoing conflict and destruction.
