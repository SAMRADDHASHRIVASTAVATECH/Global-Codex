Political Science / IR / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies / Public Policy
Political Context:

President Umaro Sissoco Embaló dissolved Parliament twice (May 2022, Dec 2023), triggering constitutional crises.

General elections scheduled for November 23, 2025—clouded by uncertainty and constitutional disputes.

Executive overreach and efforts to consolidate power (e.g., attempt to rewrite the constitution to enhance presidential authority).

Parliamentary obstruction and weakened institutional checks.

Opposition claims Embaló's term ended in Feb 2025, raising legitimacy concerns.

Governance Fragility:

Institutional instability undermines public trust.

Elite patronage networks linked to narcotrafficking and illicit logging.

SSR (Security Sector Reform) remains partial and fragile.

Economic Outlook:

2025 growth projection: ~5.1%, driven by cashew exports.

Inflation easing (~3.3%) but growth remains commodity-dependent and vulnerable to climate and market shocks.

Public debt (~80.5% of GDP) requires fiscal consolidation.

IMF and World Bank support focused on diversification, governance, and social protection.

External Relations:

Active in ECOWAS and CPLP; ECOWAS frequently mediates crises.

Increasing drug trade involvement threatens regional security.

Portugal, China, and multilaterals are key development partners.

Public Administration
Weak Institutions:

Public administration plagued by corruption, nepotism, and inefficiency.

Ranked 158/180 (TI Corruption Index, 2024).

Illicit economies (drugs, logging) entwined with formal structures.

Revenue and Spending:

Reforms underway to improve tax collection and control spending.

VAT base expansion and rationalizing tax expenditures are key strategies.

Service Delivery Challenges:

Basic services (education, health, sanitation) underfunded and inequitable, especially in rural areas.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies
Legal System: Portuguese civil law, but poorly functioning and deeply politicized.

Judicial Independence:

Severely undermined: illegal judge appointments, Supreme Court head kidnapped, MPs blocked from Parliament.

Access to justice is prohibitively expensive and geographically limited.

Human Rights Concerns (UNHRC, June 2025):

FGM prevalence remains alarming (50% national, 95%+ in Gabu).

Torture continues despite criminalization.

Police disrupt protests; journalists face harassment and violence.

Human trafficking persists, especially of children—adoption now banned.

Gender-based violence laws exist but weakly enforced.

Death Penalty: Abolished for all crimes.

Divinity / Religious Studies
Religious Landscape:

Majority Muslim, with sizable Christian and animist minorities.

High level of religious tolerance and coexistence.

Role in Society:

Religious institutions provide peace mediation, education, and social support where the state is absent.

Faith leaders serve as moral voices amid state dysfunction.

Gender Studies
FGM Crisis:

Despite criminalization, enforcement is minimal.

High FGM rates rooted in tradition and rural conservatism.

Political Representation:

Gender parity law exists, but implementation is hampered by political instability.

Economic Vulnerabilities:

Women face higher poverty rates, especially in female-headed households.

Limited access to credit, land, and employment outside of subsistence farming.

Efforts Against GBV:

Enhancing Connectivity in Northern Guinea-Bissau Project includes a gender-based violence code of conduct.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies
Ethnic Complexity:

Diverse population: Balanta, Fula, Mandinga, Papel, Manjaco.

Ethnic identity sometimes exploited for political gain.

Poverty:

~66% below national poverty line.

Rural poverty, low educational attainment, and malnutrition are persistent challenges.

Human Capital:

Low levels in health, education, and nutrition limit upward mobility.

Social Protection Expansion:

Supported by development partners to stabilize vulnerable households.

Philosophy
Rule of Law vs. Executive Power:

Ongoing crisis reflects the philosophical clash between constitutional democracy and authoritarianism.

Unity in Diversity:

Struggles over national identity and cohesion persist in a multi-ethnic society with weak state institutions.

Dignity and Development:

Poverty reduction is seen not just economically, but as a moral and societal imperative.

History
Pre-Colonial Legacy:

Part of Mali Empire, later Kaabu Kingdom.

Colonial Era:

Portuguese Guinea, with intense exploitation and underdevelopment.

Independence:

Declared in 1973, recognized in 1974 post-Portuguese Carnation Revolution.

Liberation movement led by Amílcar Cabral (assassinated 1973).

Post-Independence Turmoil:

Repeated coups, drug trafficking, weak governance define modern history.

Recent Events:

2022 & 2023 Parliament dissolutions, executive-legislative standoffs, growing concerns about presidential overreach.

Guaranteed in law, undermined in practice.

Interference and violence against reporters are common during political coverage.

Disinformation Threat:

Political actors use state media for propaganda, while digital literacy gaps allow rumors to spread.

Digital Divide:

Mobile phone and internet use rising but rural access lags significantly.

Independent Media's Role:

Despite obstacles, some journalists expose corruption and abuses, fostering accountability.

Education / Teaching
Access Gaps:

Low literacy rates, teacher shortages, and school infrastructure deficits, especially in remote areas.

Underinvestment:

Public expenditure on education is below regional average.

Human Capital Development:

Needed to increase productivity, reduce youth unemployment, and enable diversification.

Skills Mismatch:

Limited TVET (technical/vocational) training; few pathways to formal employment.

Library Science
Information Access:

Libraries offer crucial educational support, especially in underserved regions.

Cultural Preservation:

Libraries preserve oral traditions, colonial-era records, and indigenous knowledge.

Community Learning:

With the right investment, they could serve as civic spaces for literacy, youth engagement, and digital access.
