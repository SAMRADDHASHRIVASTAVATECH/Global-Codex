Serbia
Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Parliamentary Republic with Dominant Party: Serbia operates as a parliamentary republic. While formally a multi-party system, the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) led by President Aleksandar Vučić holds a dominant position, controlling a significant majority of seats in the National Assembly. This has led to accusations of increasing authoritarianism and stifling of democratic freedoms by critics.

Persistent Protests and Political Tensions (July 2025): Serbia is experiencing significant political unrest. For the past eight months (since November 2024), widespread anti-government protests have been ongoing, initially sparked by a fatal railway station collapse and growing anger over perceived government corruption and negligence. Student-led movements have been a key force, demanding early parliamentary elections and accountability. These protests have been met with police interventions, including violent clashes and detentions, and accusations of the government using "controlled, decentralized chaos" tactics to manage the demonstrations. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern over polarization, lack of trust in state institutions, and allegations of violence against peaceful protesters.

Strategic Leadership and EU Integration (amidst challenges): Despite internal political tensions, Serbia's stated strategic goal remains full membership in the European Union. However, critics argue that President Vučić's actions, including strengthening ties with Russia and China and refusing to join EU sanctions against Moscow, contradict this stated aim. The government emphasizes building bridges of cooperation in the Balkans and positioning Serbia as a pillar of stability and peace in the region.

Foreign Policy: Serbia pursues a multi-vector foreign policy, balancing its EU aspirations with strong traditional ties to Russia and growing partnerships with China.

EU Accession: EU accession remains a formal priority, but progress is slow due to concerns about rule of law, media freedom, and ongoing tensions with Kosovo. The EU has expressed support for the protesters and linked Serbia's European future to its adherence to democratic values.

Kosovo Dialogue: Normalization of relations with Kosovo remains a critical condition for EU integration. Tensions persist, and the dialogue process is often fraught with difficulties.

Russia and China: Serbia maintains close ties with Russia, particularly due to energy dependence and historical/cultural affinities. It has refused to join EU sanctions against Russia. Relations with China are also strengthening, with significant Chinese investments in infrastructure and industry.

Regional Cooperation: Serbia aims to play a central role in the Western Balkans, emphasizing economic development and regional stability, while also engaging with neighbors like Hungary on energy security.

Economic Outlook

Resilient Growth: Serbia's economy is showing resilience. The IMF projects real GDP growth at 3.0% in 2025, accelerating to 4.0% in 2026. This growth is supported by prudent macroeconomic policies, public investment, and expansion of export capacities in manufacturing. The central bank forecasts a slightly higher 4.5% GDP growth for 2025.

Key Sectors: The tertiary sector accounts for two-thirds of GDP. Manufacturing, including automotive, base metals, food processing, and chemicals, is a significant contributor. Tourism is also a growing sector.

Fiscal Discipline and Debt: The government is committed to maintaining fiscal discipline, with a fiscal deficit limit of 3.0% of GDP during 2025-27, supported by special fiscal rules on public wages and pensions. Public debt is projected to decline to 46.8% of GDP in 2025.

Inflation: Headline inflation has returned within the National Bank of Serbia's target band (3% +/- 1.5 percentage points) due to declining energy prices and moderating core inflation.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): FDI inflows have been strong, supporting economic growth, although they have moderated recently. Serbia secured its first-ever investment grade sovereign rating in 2024, reflecting improved resilience. A potential lithium deal with the EU (signed July 2024) is expected to further boost FDI.

Challenges: Elevated external vulnerabilities due to high external debt and a prevalence of foreign currency in the financial sector, as well as institutional weaknesses and geopolitical complexities, remain challenges to long-term growth and EU accession. Population aging is also a medium-term challenge for productivity.

Public Administration

Centralized Control: Public administration remains largely centralized, with significant influence from the ruling party.

Reforms for Efficiency: Reforms are aimed at strengthening public financial management, public investment management, and generally enhancing governance and transparency in government operations. The IMF welcomes the focus on ensuring transparent, accountable, and efficient government operations.

Digitalization: Efforts are underway to digitalize the public sector and judiciary, contributing to improved efficiency and service delivery.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Civil Law System: Serbia's legal system is based on civil law. The Council of Europe is an important partner in the reform of Serbia's judicial system.

Human Rights Concerns (2025):

Freedom of Expression and Assembly: Severely restricted amidst ongoing protests. Reports of raids, verbal attacks, harassment, intimidation, arbitrary arrests, threats, and smear campaigns against human rights defenders and media workers are concerning.

Police Brutality: Allegations of police brutality against peaceful demonstrators, including the use of force by unidentified officers and lack of visible identification badges, are widely reported.

Judicial Independence: Concerns about political influence on the judiciary persist. Criminal cases related to the Novi Sad tragedy (which sparked the current protests) and other allegations of violence are still under investigation with often slow judicial proceedings, and most convictions involve low-ranking officials.

Discrimination: The UN Human Rights Chief expressed concern about a rise in hate speech, online and traditional, and discrimination and marginalization against ethnic and national minorities (especially Roma), women (gender backlash, misogynistic narratives, femicide), and people with disabilities.

War Crimes Accountability: Serbia lacks a legal framework to recognize the status of missing people and the rights of their families, and victims' access to justice and reparations remains inadequate. Denial of war crimes and glorification of war criminals are issues.

SLAPP Cases: A surge in Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPP) cases against journalists aims to silence critical reporting.

Death Penalty: Abolished.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christian: The vast majority of Serbs identify as Eastern Orthodox Christian, primarily belonging to the Serbian Orthodox Church. This plays a significant role in national identity and culture.

Religious Freedom: Generally respected, though tensions can arise in areas with mixed ethnic and religious populations.

Gender Studies

Gender Backlash: A significant concern raised by the UN Human Rights Chief in May 2025 is a "gender backlash" manifesting through the recent suspension of the gender equality law, misogynistic narratives and attacks (notably against women in the public sphere), and gender-based violence including femicide.

Political Participation: While women hold some positions, their overall representation in higher political and economic spheres continues to be an area for improvement.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Strong National Identity: Serbian national identity is deeply rooted in history, language, and the Serbian Orthodox Church.

Societal Polarization: The UN Human Rights Chief noted a "profound polarization and division within society," highlighting a significant social challenge in 2025.

Protests and Social Activism: The ongoing student-led protests signify a vibrant, albeit contentious, element of social activism and a desire for change among a segment of the population.

Challenges for Minorities: The Roma community, in particular, continues to suffer from high poverty rates, exclusion, and limited access to healthcare, education, employment, and basic services.

Philosophy

Sovereignty and National Interest: The government's rhetoric emphasizes prioritizing national sovereignty and interests, particularly in its foreign policy balancing act between the EU, Russia, and China.

Stability vs. Democratic Freedoms: The ongoing protests highlight a philosophical tension between the government's pursuit of stability and economic growth (often through centralized control) versus demands for greater democratic freedoms and accountability.

European Values (contested): While formally aspiring to EU membership, the extent to which Serbia adheres to and embodies core European democratic and human rights values is a matter of ongoing debate and internal contestation.

History

Medieval Kingdom and Ottoman Rule: Serbia has a rich medieval history, followed by centuries of Ottoman rule.

Rise of Modern Serbia: Gained autonomy in the 19th century and full independence after the Congress of Berlin in 1878.

Yugoslavia and Dissolution: A key player in the formation of Yugoslavia. After the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Serbia faced significant conflicts and internal turmoil, including the Kosovo War.

Post-Milosevic Era and EU Path: Since the fall of Slobodan Milošević in 2000, Serbia has embarked on a path towards democratic reform and EU integration, a process marked by both progress and setbacks. The current political climate in 2025 reflects ongoing challenges in fully consolidating democratic institutions.

Social Work

Addressing Social Disparities: Social work focuses on addressing social disparities, poverty (around 19.9% in 2023), and the needs of vulnerable groups, including the Roma community and those impacted by economic transitions.

Trauma and Mental Health: The legacy of the 1990s conflicts can lead to ongoing social and psychological challenges, requiring social support services.

Public Assistance: Government programs provide social assistance, but resources and efficiency can vary.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Suppressed Media Freedom: Media freedom is a major concern. Independent journalists face assaults, threats (including death threats), and smear campaigns from pro-government media and public officials. SLAPP lawsuits are used to silence investigative journalism.

Dominant Pro-Government Media: The media landscape is heavily dominated by pro-government outlets, leading to a lack of diverse and critical perspectives.

Digital Surveillance: Reports of unlawful digital surveillance of human rights defenders and media workers are a concern.

Education / Teaching

Student Activism: University students are a prominent force in the current anti-government protests, highlighting dissatisfaction within the education sector and broader society.

Funding Concerns: Students' demands include an increase in the budget for higher education. The government's decision to cut professors' salaries for lectures missed due to protests has fueled further discontent.

Study Abroad Programs: The "Study in Serbia" initiative promotes the country as a destination for international students, with catalogues for the 2025/2026 academic year available.

Library Science

Access to Information (Challenged): While libraries provide access to information, the broader climate of restricted media freedom and potential digital surveillance could indirectly impact the accessibility and diversity of information.

Cultural and Historical Preservation: Libraries remain vital for preserving Serbia's rich cultural and historical heritage, including its literary works and scholarly output.
