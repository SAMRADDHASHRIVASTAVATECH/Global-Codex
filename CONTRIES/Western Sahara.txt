Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Undetermined Status and Ongoing Dispute (July 2025): Western Sahara remains a "non-self-governing territory" under the UN Special Committee on Decolonization. Its legal status and sovereignty are officially undetermined. The territory is largely under the de facto control of Morocco, which refers to it as its "Southern Provinces" and proposes an autonomy plan. The Polisario Front, which proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in 1976, continues to advocate for a referendum on self-determination, including the option of independence.

International Positions:

Morocco: Claims sovereignty over the entire territory and views the Polisario Front as a separatist movement. Its autonomy proposal (2007) is seen as the "only basis for a just and lasting solution" by a growing number of countries.

Polisario Front/SADR: Considers itself a national liberation movement and the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people. It maintains that a referendum on self-determination, with independence as an option, is the only path to a just solution. The SADR has diplomatic relations with numerous countries, primarily from Africa, Latin America, and Asia.

United Nations: Continues to support UN-led efforts to achieve a "just, lasting, and mutually acceptable political solution" that provides for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) remains deployed with a budget of over $70 million for the period of July 2024 to June 2025, primarily to monitor the ceasefire (though it largely broke down in late 2020) and political developments.

Key International Players:

United States: Under the Trump administration in 2020, recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. This position has been reaffirmed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in April 2025.

France: President Emmanuel Macron endorsed Moroccan sovereignty in October 2024.

United Kingdom: In June 2025, the UK Government announced a new policy, considering Morocco's autonomy proposal as the "most credible, viable and pragmatic basis for a lasting resolution." However, the official parliamentary record on June 12, 2025, also states the UK continues to regard the status as "undetermined."

Algeria: Strong supporter of the Polisario Front and advocates for the self-determination of the Sahrawi people through a referendum. Algeria cut ties with Morocco in 2021, and tensions remain high.

The Berm: A heavily fortified sand berm constructed by Morocco separates the Moroccan-administered western portion of the territory from the eastern part controlled by the Polisario.

Referendum Stalemate: Plans for a referendum, first proposed in the 1960s, have never materialized, primarily due to disagreements over voter eligibility.

Economic Outlook

Moroccan-Administered Area: The Moroccan-controlled part of Western Sahara has a small market-based economy. Its main industries are fishing, phosphate mining, and tourism. Morocco has poured considerable resources into infrastructure development and social spending. However, the region is arid and imports much of its food.

Polisario-Administered Area (Free Zone): This eastern portion is sparsely populated and primarily characterized by pastoral nomadism. There is very little economic infrastructure.

Contested Resources: The exploitation of Western Sahara's natural resources (phosphates, fisheries, potential for oil and renewable energy) is highly contentious. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has repeatedly ruled against the inclusion of products originating from Western Sahara in EU-Morocco trade and fisheries agreements without the consent of the indigenous Sahrawi people.

Limited Data: Comprehensive and reliable economic data specifically for Western Sahara is scarce due to its disputed status. Figures available often predate the recent rise in global inflation and ongoing regional tensions.

Regional Economic Outlook (MENA): The broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, which includes Western Sahara, is projected to see growth rise to 2.7% in 2025, but global trade tensions and policy uncertainty could impact this.

Public Administration

Dual Administration (De Facto): In the Moroccan-controlled areas, public administration is managed by the Moroccan government, integrating the territory into its provincial structure. Residents participate in Moroccan elections.

SADR Administration (In Exile/Refugee Camps): The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), proclaimed by the Polisario Front, has a government-in-exile based primarily in the Tindouf refugee camps in Algeria. It seeks to administer the Polisario-controlled "Free Zone."

SADR Strategic Planning: The SADR government actively engages in strategic planning, as evidenced by the presentation of a "Youth Strategic Plan 2025-2030" in July 2025, aiming to empower Sahrawi youth in refugee camps.

UN Mission (MINURSO): MINURSO's mandate (July 2024 - June 2025 budget) includes monitoring the ceasefire, reporting on the ground situation, and observing political and security developments. However, it has struggled to organize the referendum as originally envisioned.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Differing Legal Systems: Two distinct legal systems operate de facto in Western Sahara: Moroccan law in the territory under its control, and the legal framework of the SADR in the Polisario-controlled areas and refugee camps.

Human Rights Concerns (Moroccan Control): International human rights organizations and Sahrawi activists frequently report widespread human rights violations in Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara, including restrictions on freedom of expression, arbitrary arrests, and political imprisonment. Calls persist for independent investigations and the release of Sahrawi political prisoners.

Human Rights Concerns (Tindouf Camps): Allegations of human rights abuses, including forced marriage, gender-based violence, restrictions on movement, and misuse of humanitarian aid, have been raised concerning the Tindouf refugee camps under Polisario administration. There are calls for independent investigations and a transparent referendum for camp residents.

International Law and Resources: The legal status of resource exploitation (fishing, phosphates) by Morocco in Western Sahara without the consent of the Sahrawi people continues to be a major legal point of contention, with European courts ruling against such agreements. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1975 found no legal ties of sovereignty between Morocco and Western Sahara.

"Development as Domination": Critics argue that Morocco's development projects and economic integration efforts in Western Sahara normalize its occupation and violate international law.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Predominantly Muslim: The vast majority of the population in Western Sahara, both Sahrawis and Moroccan settlers, are Sunni Muslims.

Sufi Influence: Historically, Sufi brotherhoods have played a significant role in Sahrawi society.

Religious Freedom: While the region is overwhelmingly Muslim, the specific nuances of religious freedom and the extent of state influence over religious practice differ between Moroccan-controlled areas and the Polisario-administered camps.

Gender Studies

Women in Polisario/Camps: Women in the Tindouf refugee camps have historically played a significant role in administration and social organization within the camps. However, concerns about forced marriage, gender-based violence, and restrictions on movement and expression within the camps have been raised by some petitioners to the UN.

Impact of Conflict: The ongoing conflict and displacement have a profound impact on gender roles and experiences, with women often bearing the brunt of socio-economic hardship and maintaining family structures in challenging environments.

Representation: The extent of women's political participation and representation in both the Moroccan-administered areas and the SADR government varies.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Sahrawi Identity: The indigenous people of Western Sahara, the Sahrawis, are of Arab-Berber descent with a distinct culture and dialect (Hassaniya Arabic). Their identity is strongly tied to their nomadic pastoralist heritage, though many have been compelled to adopt a more sedentary, urban lifestyle due to the conflict.

Refugee Experience: A significant portion of the Sahrawi population lives in refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria, for nearly five decades. Their experiences of displacement, separation from their traditional lands, and reliance on international aid have profoundly shaped their social and cultural structures.

Moroccan Settlement: Morocco has also encouraged the settlement of Moroccan citizens in the territory it controls, further altering the demographic landscape.

Cultural Preservation: Efforts exist to preserve Sahrawi cultural heritage, including music, poetry, and nomadic traditions, especially among the displaced population.

Philosophy

Self-Determination vs. Territorial Integrity: This is the central philosophical tension of the Western Sahara conflict. The Sahrawi people, supported by the Polisario Front, assert their right to self-determination as a fundamental principle of decolonization. Morocco asserts its historical claim and territorial integrity, considering Western Sahara an integral part of its kingdom.

Justice and International Law: The conflict raises profound philosophical questions about justice, international law, and the effectiveness of international mechanisms (like the UN) in resolving disputes over decolonization and sovereignty.

Legitimacy of Authority: The differing claims to legitimate authority over the territory (Morocco's de facto control vs. the SADR's claim to represent the Sahrawi people) create a complex philosophical challenge for international recognition and engagement.

History

Spanish Colony: Western Sahara was colonized by Spain, becoming Spanish Sahara in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

ICJ Advisory Opinion (1975): In 1975, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion stating that Western Sahara was not terra nullius (land belonging to no one) at the time of Spanish colonization and found no legal ties of territorial sovereignty between Western Sahara and either Morocco or Mauritania that would prevent the application of the principle of self-determination.

Green March and Moroccan Occupation (1975): Following the ICJ opinion, Morocco launched the "Green March," sending 350,000 unarmed civilians into Western Sahara. Spain subsequently withdrew, and Morocco and Mauritania partitioned the territory.

Polisario Front and SADR (1976): The Polisario Front, which had been fighting for independence from Spain, continued its struggle against Morocco and Mauritania. In 1976, it proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).

Mauritanian Withdrawal (1979): Mauritania withdrew its claim to Western Sahara in 1979 after signing a peace agreement with the Polisario Front. Morocco then occupied the southern portion previously held by Mauritania.

Ceasefire and MINURSO (1991): A UN-brokered ceasefire was established in 1991, and MINURSO was deployed with the objective of organizing a referendum on self-determination.

Breakdown of Ceasefire (2020): The ceasefire largely broke down in November 2020 after the Polisario Front declared the end of the 1991 ceasefire agreement following a Moroccan military operation.

Recent Diplomatic Shifts (2020-2025): The Trump administration's recognition of Moroccan sovereignty in 2020 and subsequent endorsements from France and the UK have significantly impacted the diplomatic landscape.

Social Work

Refugee Support: Social work is critical in the Tindouf refugee camps, addressing the long-term needs of the Sahrawi population, including food security, healthcare, education, and psychological support for those who have lived in displacement for decades.

Humanitarian Aid: Social workers facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid and ensure its equitable access, amidst concerns about potential diversion.

Addressing Vulnerabilities: Focus is on supporting vulnerable groups, including women, children, and the elderly, who are disproportionately affected by the prolonged conflict and refugee status.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Information Control: Information regarding Western Sahara is often filtered through the perspectives of Morocco, the Polisario Front, and international media. Both sides actively engage in public relations and lobbying efforts.

Access Challenges: Access for independent journalists to both Moroccan-controlled areas and the Polisario-administered zone can be challenging, impacting comprehensive reporting.

Digital Platforms: Social media and digital platforms are used by Sahrawi activists and Moroccan authorities to disseminate information and mobilize support for their respective causes.

Education / Teaching

Education in Refugee Camps: The SADR operates an education system within the Tindouf refugee camps, emphasizing Sahrawi identity and history.

Education in Moroccan-Controlled Areas: Education in the Moroccan-controlled areas follows the Moroccan national curriculum.

Challenges: Both systems face challenges, including limited resources, particularly in the refugee camps, and differing educational philosophies reflecting the political divide.

Library Science

Preservation of Sahrawi Heritage: Libraries and cultural institutions (especially in the Tindouf camps or in the diaspora) play a crucial role in preserving Sahrawi cultural heritage, including oral traditions, historical documents, and literary works, in the face of displacement and potential cultural erasure.

Information Access for Refugees: Libraries in the camps would provide essential information resources for the refugee population.

Documentation of Conflict: Library and archival efforts are also important for documenting the history of the conflict and the experiences of the Sahrawi people.
