Intensifying Authoritarianism and Political Turmoil (July 2025): Turkey is experiencing significant political turmoil, marked by an increasing shift towards authoritarianism under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his AK Party.

Imamoğlu's Arrest and Protests: A major development in March 2025 was the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, a prominent opposition figure and the Republican People's Party (CHP) nominee for the next presidential election. He was later charged with corruption, a move widely condemned by the opposition as politically motivated and an "assault on what remains of Turkey's electoral institutions." This arrest triggered widespread protests across major Turkish cities, including Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, and Adana, with thousands demonstrating against the government and chanting anti-Erdoğan slogans. Police responded with barricades, pepper spray, and detentions, and social media platforms were restricted.

Weakening of Democratic Institutions: Critics argue that since 2002, the AKP has gradually weakened democratic institutions, particularly after 2017 reforms created a dominant presidency. İmamoğlu's arrest signals a potential move towards a system where elections may no longer enable meaningful change.

Opposition Resilience: Despite the authoritarian turn, the opposition has shown resilience, notably winning unexpected victories in the 2019 and 2024 local elections, including in key cities like Istanbul and Ankara. This resilience is attributed to Turkey's diverse society and the CHP's ability to unite various opposition parties.

Judicial Interference: The government maintains that the judiciary is independent, but many disagree, pointing to the timing of İmamoğlu's arrest and the Istanbul University's cancellation of his degree just days before the primary.

Defense Challenges and Political Interference: A new regulation passed in June 2025 allows President Erdoğan to directly influence the promotion timeline of senior officers, raising concerns about undermining meritocracy and increasing political interference within the Turkish Armed Forces.

Foreign Policy and Geopolitical Positioning: Turkey continues to pursue a pragmatic and interest-based foreign policy, prioritizing security, economic resilience, and strategic autonomy in an increasingly competitive global environment.

NATO and F-16s: Turkey's efforts to modernize its armed forces are hampered by sanctions and procurement delays, including the acquisition of F-35 aircraft and upgrades for its aging F-16 fighter jet fleet. While the Biden administration tentatively approved F-16 sales after Turkey's ratification of Sweden's NATO accession, the US Congress has yet to finalize the deal, impairing Turkey's air force combat readiness.

European Relations: President Erdoğan has renewed focus on European Union membership, though Europe's stance remains cautious, often citing concerns over Turkey's domestic policies and human rights record. Despite recognizing Turkey's strategic importance, Europe has been deliberate in excluding Turkey from its defense and security architectures, leading to a "selective engagement" approach from Turkey.

Middle East Focus: Turkey is actively balancing its deterrence capacity with diplomatic tools in the Middle East, particularly concerning Syria. President Erdoğan's message on Syria indicates a strong focus on preventing destabilization. Turkey is also seeking de-escalation mechanisms with Israel amidst regional tensions.

Multilateral Engagement: Turkey continues its diplomatic activities through platforms like the Antalya Diplomacy Forum, advocating for a more inclusive and equitable global order. It participates in various international forums, including the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Organization of Turkic States.

Economic Outlook

Moderate Growth and Disinflation Efforts (July 2025): Turkey's economy is expected to continue with moderate growth in 2025, projected at around 2.7% (Wikipedia), 3.1% (World Bank), or 3.2% (World Bank, earlier forecast). The primary policy objective remains price stability and advancing disinflation.

Inflation Challenges: While disinflation is advancing, inflation is still expected to remain high, projected to reach the upper 20s by the end of 2025 (World Bank). The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (CBRT) maintained its year-end inflation forecast at 24% for 2025. This requires tighter fiscal and monetary policies to re-anchor expectations.

Monetary Policy: The CBRT raised its policy rate to 46% in April 2025 in the context of domestic financial turmoil, demonstrating a commitment to tight monetary policy. Expectations for the first interest rate cut from the CBRT are anticipated in July 2025, but the bank remains cautious.

Fiscal Consolidation: The general government deficit is expected to decrease to 4.2% of GDP in 2025, largely due to a decline in earthquake-related spending. The budget posted a surplus through corporate tax in May 2025, though this might not indicate an underlying trend improvement.

Current Account Balance: The current account deficit widened in April 2025 to $7.9 billion. The 12-month cumulative current account deficit has also widened.

Key Economic Sectors:

Tourism: Continues to be a significant contributor, accounting for 12% of GDP in 2023, making Turkey the fifth most visited destination globally.

Manufacturing: A strong sector, particularly in motor vehicles, consumer electronics, home appliances, and defense products.

Defense Industry: The defense industry is a strategic priority, with ongoing projects like the indigenous Kaan aircraft, Steel Dome air defense, and Altay tank. However, the depreciation of the Turkish lira makes importing defense hardware more expensive.

Poverty and Employment: The unemployment rate was 8.2% in February 2025. The poverty rate is projected to further decline to 4.9% in 2025, driven by wage income (including minimum wage increases of 30% in 2025) and a strong labor market.

Public Administration

Centralization of Power: The increasing centralization of power under the presidency affects public administration, with concerns about political interference in various state institutions. The new regulation allowing direct presidential influence over senior military officer promotions is an example.

Focus on Efficiency and Modernization: Despite political challenges, there is an ongoing push for modernization and efficiency within public services, as is common in developing economies aiming for economic stability and growth. However, concerns about transparency and accountability may arise due to the weakening of democratic checks and balances.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Human Rights Concerns and Judicial Independence: The human rights situation is a major concern, particularly following the arrest of Ekrem İmamoğlu and other opposition figures. Critics allege that the justice system is not independent and is used to target political opponents.

Freedom of Assembly: Protests against İmamoğlu's arrest in March 2025 were met with police intervention, including prohibitions on public gatherings, barricades, pepper spray, and detentions, raising concerns about the right to peaceful assembly.

LGBTQ+ Rights: There is an ongoing crackdown on the LGBTQ+ community. In June 2025, police detained dozens at a banned LGBTQ+ Pride parade in Istanbul. President Erdoğan has adopted increasingly harsh rhetoric against the community, declaring 2025 the "Year of the Family" and accusing the LGBTQ+ movement of threatening traditional family values. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International warn that this rhetoric creates a hostile environment.

Legal Reforms (Rehabilitation): A new judicial bill passed in June 2025 aims to improve criminal rehabilitation in Turkey. However, this is set against a backdrop of broader concerns about the rule of law.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Predominantly Sunni Muslim: Turkey is overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. The Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) plays a significant role in managing religious affairs and promoting Sunni Islam.

Secular State Principle: While predominantly Muslim, Turkey officially adheres to a principle of secularism (laicism), enshrined in its constitution, which aims to separate state and religious affairs. However, critics argue that the ruling AKP has increasingly blurred the lines, promoting a more conservative and religiously-oriented public sphere.

Religious Freedom: While generally observed, concerns exist regarding the rights of religious minorities and the government's influence over religious education and institutions.

Gender Studies

Women's Political Representation: While the CHP has introduced a 50% women's quota in internal bodies under its new leadership, broader political representation for women remains a challenge within the current political climate.

LGBTQ+ Rights and Gender Identity: The government's increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community, including the focus on "traditional family values" in the "Year of the Family 2025," has negative implications for gender equality and the recognition of diverse gender identities. This contributes to a hostile environment and potential for increased discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ individuals.

Impact of Authoritarianism: The general backsliding in human rights and democratic freedoms in Turkey disproportionately affects vulnerable groups, including women and LGBTQ+ individuals, whose rights may be further curtailed.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Diverse Ethnic Makeup: Turkey is ethnically diverse, with a large Turkish majority and significant Kurdish, Arab, Zaza, and other minority populations. This diversity is reflected in its rich cultural tapestry.

Nationalism and Identity: Turkish nationalism remains a strong force, shaping national identity and political discourse.

Secular vs. Conservative Divide: A persistent social and cultural divide exists between secular and conservative segments of society, which often manifests in political alignment and cultural practices. The current political climate often exacerbates this divide.

Youth and Protests: The widespread protests in March 2025, involving students and municipal workers, highlight significant social discontent, particularly among youth who are demanding democratic processes and accountability.

Philosophy

Democracy vs. Authoritarianism: The central philosophical tension in Turkey revolves around the ongoing struggle between democratic ideals (rule of law, free elections, civil liberties) and the consolidation of executive power leading towards authoritarianism. The arrest of İmamoğlu directly challenges the notion of fair elections and democratic accountability.

Justice and Legality: The government's claim of an independent judiciary versus the opposition's accusations of political interference raises fundamental philosophical questions about the nature of justice, the rule of law, and the interpretation of legal processes.

National Identity and Modernity: Turkey continues to grapple with its national identity, balancing its historical and religious roots with its aspirations for modernity and European integration, a philosophical debate that impacts domestic policies and foreign relations.

History

Ottoman Empire Legacy: Turkey is the successor state to the Ottoman Empire, inheriting a rich and complex imperial history.

Republic of Turkey (Atatürk's Reforms): Established in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the Republic embarked on a radical modernization and secularization program.

Military Interventions and Democracy: Turkey has a history of military interventions in politics. While it has sought to establish a robust democracy, it has faced challenges, including coups and periods of political instability.

AKP Era (since 2002): The Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, came to power in 2002. Initially praised for economic reforms, the AKP has increasingly centralized power, particularly after the 2016 coup attempt and the 2017 constitutional referendum.

Recent Events: The period leading up to and including July 2025 has been marked by significant internal political strife, including the detention of a prominent opposition figure, widespread protests, and increasing concerns about human rights and the rule of law.

Social Work

Support for Victims of Political Repression: Social workers are increasingly needed to support individuals and families affected by political arrests, detentions, and human rights abuses, including psychosocial support and advocacy.

Vulnerable Populations: The impact of economic challenges, such as inflation, can disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, increasing the need for social welfare programs and support services.

LGBTQ+ Community Support: Given the heightened rhetoric and actions against the LGBTQ+ community, social workers play a crucial role in providing support, safe spaces, and advocating for their rights.

Community Cohesion: In a polarized society, social workers can contribute to fostering community cohesion and addressing social tensions, though this work may be challenging in the current political climate.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Severe Restrictions on Media Freedom: Media freedom in Turkey is heavily restricted. The government is accused of controlling media narratives and suppressing dissenting voices.

Social Media Restrictions: During times of protest, internet access, particularly to social media platforms like X, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, is restricted, hindering the free flow of information and organizing protests.

Harassment of Journalists: Journalists who are critical of the government face harassment, legal prosecution, and detention, leading to self-censorship and a decline in independent reporting.

Propaganda and Disinformation: The media landscape is often dominated by pro-government outlets, contributing to a climate where propaganda and disinformation can flourish.

Education / Teaching

Curriculum Changes (2024-2025 School Year): The 2024-2025 school year began with a new curriculum, suggesting ongoing reforms in the education system.

Academic Freedom Concerns: The broader crackdown on civil liberties can impact academic freedom, potentially leading to self-censorship in research and teaching, particularly on sensitive political or social topics.

Higher Education: The incident involving Istanbul University canceling İmamoğlu's degree raises concerns about political influence over academic institutions and the integrity of higher education.

Skills Development: Efforts are likely ongoing to align education with the needs of the Turkish economy, particularly in sectors like manufacturing and defense, to enhance human capital and productivity.

Library Science

Preserving Cultural and Historical Heritage: Libraries in Turkey play a critical role in preserving its vast and diverse cultural and historical heritage, from ancient texts to Ottoman manuscripts and modern Turkish literature.

Access to Information: While libraries traditionally provide public access to information, the broader restrictions on freedom of expression and information in Turkey could pose challenges, potentially influencing collection development and access to certain materials.

Digitalization and Modernization: Libraries are likely to be involved in digitalization efforts to make their collections more accessible and to adapt to modern information needs, supporting research and public education.

Role in Promoting Literacy: With a significant population, libraries contribute to promoting literacy and providing educational resources to various communities across the country.
