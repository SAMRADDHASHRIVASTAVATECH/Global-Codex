Self-Governing in Free Association: As of July 2025, the Cook Islands continues its unique political status as a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand. This grants it full responsibility for internal and foreign affairs, while New Zealand retains responsibility for defense and foreign affairs only at the Cook Islands' request.

Constitutional Monarchy with Parliamentary Democracy: The Cook Islands operates as a parliamentary representative democracy within a constitutional monarchy. King Charles III is the Head of State, represented by the King's Representative, Sir Tom Marsters. Mark Brown (Cook Islands Party - CIP) remains the Prime Minister, holding this position since October 2020.

Parliamentary Structure: The Parliament of the Cook Islands comprises 24 members, elected for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies. There is also a House of Ariki (composed of chiefs) and a Koutu Nui (sub-chiefs), both with advisory roles.

Regional Architecture Review (July 2025): The Cook Islands is actively participating in a High-Level Political Talanoa (HLPT) as part of Phase 3 of the Review of the Regional Architecture (RRA) for the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). This process, culminating in the 54th Pacific Islands Forum in September 2025, aims to ensure regional institutions are "fit for purpose, responsive to the evolving needs of Pacific nations, and aligned with the shared vision under the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent." The Cook Islands emphasizes preserving Pacific political leadership and ensuring Pacific Island countries can make decisions free from undue external influence.

China-Cook Islands Partnership: In February 2025, the Cook Islands signed a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership – Joint Action Plan with China. The Cook Islands government has stressed that this agreement is non-binding, contains no security or defense arrangements, and focuses on climate and economic resilience, sustainable development, and marine science.

New Zealand Funding Pause: New Zealand has paused development funding support, reportedly due to concerns regarding the China agreement and differing interpretations of consultation requirements. A Formal Dialogue Mechanism between the Cook Islands and New Zealand has been established and is making progress in identifying risk mitigation. The Cook Islands remains committed to its close security and defense partnership with New Zealand.

UN Membership Discussions: Prime Minister Mark Brown stated in 2025 that the UN has confirmed the Cook Islands does not currently meet the requirements for full UN membership. However, it participates in UN specialized agencies and can sign and ratify UN treaties open to "non-member states."

Economic Outlook

Tourism-Driven Growth: The Cook Islands' economy is heavily reliant on tourism. Projections for 2025 anticipate a record-breaking year for tourism, with visitor numbers expected to surpass pre-pandemic 2019 levels. The first quarter of 2025 showed a 20% increase compared to the same period in 2024. This growth is fueled by expanded air connectivity across four international carriers.

Sustainable Tourism Focus: Despite the projected growth, Cook Islands Tourism is prioritizing sustainable growth, shifting from a focus on volume to value, aiming to deliver better experiences and long-term benefits to the people, environment, and culture. A National Destination Stewardship Plan is under development to guide this shift.

Minimum Wage Increase (July 2025): Effective July 1, 2025, the minimum wage in the Cook Islands will increase by 50 cents, from $9.50 to $10 per hour. While welcomed by some, others argue it's insufficient given the rising cost of living, particularly for rentals and food. Smaller tourism businesses may feel the impact of this increase.

Migration Trends: In May 2025, the Cook Islands saw 17,140 total arrivals (15,757 visitors and 1,383 returning Cook Islanders/work permit holders). New Zealand accounts for the majority of visitor arrivals (63.8%), followed by Australia (25.6%). A total of 1,287 residents left the country in May 2025.

Public Administration

Central and Local Government: The Office of the Prime Minister supports the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Cook Islands is divided into administrative districts with local governance.

Concerns over Transnational Gangs: Local authorities are expressing serious concern about the growing presence and influence of organized gang members from New Zealand with Cook Islands heritage. Police confirm the Cook Islands is affected by transnational gang mobility across the Pacific. This poses challenges for law enforcement and for at-risk youth, particularly those sent from New Zealand or Australia due to family problems.

Inter-Agency Cooperation: Cook Islands Police are part of a broader multi-agency network including Immigration, Customs, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), and Transnational Crime Units (TCUs) across the region to tackle these issues. Strengthening tactical cooperation with international law enforcement is a top priority.

Police Staffing Shortages: The Cook Islands Police Service has been facing staffing shortages due to budget cuts and uncompetitive remuneration, with around 30-40 vacancies as of early 2025.

Other significant denominations include Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Impact of Economic Changes: While specific gender studies reports for July 2025 are not available, economic changes like the minimum wage increase and rising cost of living can have varied impacts on different genders, depending on employment sectors and household structures.
