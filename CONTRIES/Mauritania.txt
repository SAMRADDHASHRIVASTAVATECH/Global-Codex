Mauritania, a West African nation bridging the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa, is in mid-2025 navigating a complex landscape of persistent human rights challenges, efforts towards economic diversification, and a crucial role in regional security. While the country held presidential elections in June 2024, seeing the incumbent win a second term, the fight against slavery and other human rights abuses remains a central and contentious issue. Economically, Mauritania is poised for significant growth driven by gas production, but it must address poverty and climate vulnerabilities.

Achieving "complete mastery" of Mauritania requires a deep understanding of its unique ethno-racial composition and the legacy of slavery, which continues to impact its social fabric and human rights record; its arid geography, making it highly vulnerable to climate change and desertification; its economy, heavily reliant on mining (iron ore, gold) and fishing, with new prospects in offshore gas; its semi-presidential political system and ongoing efforts towards democratic consolidation amidst significant challenges to civil liberties; and its strategic position in the Sahel region, crucial for counter-terrorism efforts. Familiarity with Arabic (official) and French (widely used in administration and business), as well as local languages like Pulaar, Soninke, and Wolof, is essential.

Political Science / International Relations / International Affairs / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies
These fields are crucial for understanding Mauritania's governance, its global engagement, and its policy responses to contemporary issues.

Essential Overviews & Political Climate (Mid-2025):

Presidential Election (June 2024): Incumbent President Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani secured a second term with 56.12% of the vote. While international observers from the African Union reported no major incidents, the main opposition (anti-slavery campaigner Biram Dah Abeid) alleged fraud and irregularities. This indicates continued political contestation and questions about the fairness of electoral processes.

Government Stability: President Ghazouani's government maintains a strong majority in the National Assembly (from May 2023 elections) and is pursuing a "Mon ambition pour la nation" program focused on institutional governance, economic resilience, human capital development, social inclusion, and security.

Combating Corruption: The government has expressed commitment to combating corruption, with new laws on asset declarations and an anti-corruption authority being part of its Governance Action Plan. The IMF encourages swift execution of these.

Strategic Leadership: Key focus areas include combating corruption, empowering youth, improving education, agricultural transformation, and national security, especially in the context of persistent threats from the Sahel.

International Relations:

IMF and World Bank Engagement: Mauritania has a strong relationship with the IMF and World Bank, having reached staff-level agreements in May 2025 for continued economic programs (Extended Fund Facility, Extended Credit Facility, Resilience and Sustainability Facility). This indicates commitment to macroeconomic stability and structural reforms.

Regional Security: Mauritania plays a critical role in regional counter-terrorism efforts in the Sahel. It participates in Operation Enduring Freedom - Trans Sahara. UNODC is supporting Mauritania in efforts to prevent and counter the nexus between terrorism and organized crime, holding training workshops in April 2025.

EU Relations: Has signed "expensive deals" with the European Union to curb irregular migration to Europe, leading to controversial mass migrant pushbacks (May 2025).

African Union (AU) Leadership: President Ghazouani formerly chaired the African Union, underscoring Mauritania's regional diplomatic standing.

Partnership for Information and Democracy: Mauritania joined this partnership in December 2024, signifying a commitment to enhancing democratic rules in the global information space and improving press freedom, aligning with a notable rise in its RSF press freedom index ranking in 2024.

Economic Outlook:

Diversification and Growth: The medium-term outlook is favorable, with GDP growth projected to average 5.1% over 2025–2027 (World Bank), driven primarily by the launch of gas production and exports under the Grand Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) project.

GDP Growth (2025): Projected to decelerate slightly to 4.0% in 2025 (IMF) or 4.4% (World Economics) due to a contraction in the extractive sector (gold and iron ore production may decline). Overall GDP (nominal) estimated at $11.47 billion in 2025 (IMF).

Inflation: Expected to reach 3.5% in 2025 (IMF) and converge toward 4.0% thereafter, after declining to 1.5% (year-on-year) in December 2024.

Fiscal Position: Fiscal deficit is expected to average -1.1% of GDP over 2025–2027 due to increased investment spending, partially offset by rising gas revenues. The 2024 deficit was 0.1% of GDP, indicating strong fiscal consolidation. Public debt is projected to stabilize at 43.7% of GDP by 2027, maintaining a moderate risk of debt distress.

Key Sectors:

Extractive Industries: Iron ore and gold are major exports. The GTA gas project is a game-changer, but its launch may partially offset declines in other mining.

Agriculture and Fishing: Remain foundational, though modest agricultural performance and climate vulnerability are concerns.

Social Safety Nets: Significant efforts to strengthen social protection through targeted cash transfer programs, replacing generalized subsidies. The Tekavoul program is highlighted for its effectiveness, supporting over 131,000 households, including refugees.

Challenges:

Poverty: Despite economic growth, poverty is expected to rise, with the poverty rate potentially increasing to 31.8% by 2027, bringing an estimated 193,000 people into poverty due to rising food prices and modest agricultural performance.

Vulnerability to Shocks: Persistent risks linked to commodity price volatility and climate-related shocks.

Economic Diversification: The need to diversify the economy and invest mining revenues into productive non-extractive sectors to ensure inclusive growth.

Public Administration
Focuses on the structure of governance and administrative challenges.

Decentralization: Control remains tightly concentrated in the executive branch, though national and municipal elections have produced limited decentralization.

Judicial Reforms: Establishment of a new, consolidated specialized court in February 2025 to prosecute cases of slavery, human trafficking, and migrant smuggling is a significant administrative reform aimed at strengthening justice.

Governance Action Plan: Steadfast execution of the homegrown Governance Action Plan, including laws on asset declarations and the anti-corruption authority, is seen as crucial for transparency and accountability.

Civil Service Capacity: Need for continued capacity building in various ministries and agencies to effectively implement reforms and development projects.

Criminal Justice / Law / Laws / Legal Studies / Studies in Law
Understanding Mauritania's legal system and its human rights framework.

Legal System: A civil law system, strongly influenced by Islamic (Sharia) law.

Human Rights Concerns (Mid-2025) - Pervasive and Systemic:

Slavery: Despite being officially abolished in 1981 and criminalized in 2007 (and further strengthened in 2015 as a crime against humanity), modern slavery remains a persistent issue. Individuals (primarily from the Haratin community, descendants of former slaves) continue to experience violence, intimidation, forced separation, and systemic denial of rights.

Specialized Court: The establishment of a new, consolidated specialized court in February 2025 dedicated to prosecuting slavery, human trafficking, and migrant smuggling is a significant legal development aimed at improving accountability and access to justice for victims.

Repression of Anti-Slavery Activists: In May 2025, there were reports of a "wave of repression" targeting anti-slavery activists (e.g., IRA-Mauritania), including violent dispersal of protests, arbitrary arrests, judicial harassment, and alleged physical assault of female protesters. This highlights the government's attempts to silence critical voices.

Freedom of Expression, Assembly, and Association: Severely restricted, particularly for human rights defenders and civil society. Protests are violently dispersed, activists are arbitrarily detained and prosecuted.

Deaths in Custody: Concerns persist regarding deaths in police custody, with past cases (e.g., Souvi Ould Jibril Ould Cheine in February 2023) raising allegations of torture and lack of accountability.

Migrant Pushbacks: In May 2025, Mauritania conducted mass pushbacks of migrants (including Senegalese and Malian nationals, some with legal residency) to its neighbors, citing a crackdown on human smuggling. These pushbacks were described as "xenophobic" by neighboring governments and involved allegations of random arrests, detention in tight cells, and torture. This raises serious concerns about inhumane treatment and due process violations, especially given EU deals to curb migration.

Racial Discrimination: The human rights situation of the Haratin community and Afro-Mauritanians remains precarious, facing systemic discrimination, limited access to education and employment, and political disenfranchisement. There are concerns about "forced Arabization" through Arabic-only education laws.

Women's Rights: While specific details for mid-2025 are limited, the OHCHR supports Mauritania in challenging gender stereotypes in sports (e.g., women's football). The UN Working Group on discrimination against women and girls issued a report on its visit in June 2024. The new legislature has 24.2% women, almost unchanged from the previous one.

Children's Rights: Mauritania ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Terrorism and Organized Crime Nexus: UNODC is working with Mauritanian authorities to strengthen capacities to prevent and counter the nexus between terrorism and organized crime, including through training workshops.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies
Exploring the religious landscape and its social role.

State Religion: Islam (Sunni) is the state religion, and the legal system is influenced by Sharia law.

Religious Homogeneity: The vast majority of the population is Sunni Muslim, contributing to a relatively homogeneous religious landscape.

Role of Religious Leaders: Religious leaders play a significant role in society, often holding considerable influence.

Gender Studies
Examining gender equality and women's rights in Mauritania.

Political Representation: Women constitute 24.2% of the National Assembly after the May 2023 legislative elections, a figure that remains relatively static.

Gender-Based Violence: While specific data for mid-2025 is not detailed, the OHCHR supports efforts to address human rights, including GBV.

Intersectionality: Women from marginalized communities, particularly Haratin women, face intersecting forms of discrimination based on gender and caste/ethnic background.

Empowerment Initiatives: The World Bank supports new operations focusing on women's empowerment and the demographic dividend, as part of efforts to improve living standards.

Challenging Stereotypes: OHCHR highlights efforts to challenge gender stereotypes, such as in women's football, as part of broader human rights work.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies
These fields provide insights into Mauritania's unique culture and social dynamics.

Ethno-Racial Diversity & Hierarchy: Mauritania's society is composed of a complex ethno-racial hierarchy, traditionally categorized into Bidhan (white Moors), Haratin (Black Moors, descendants of former slaves), and various sub-Saharan African ethnic groups (Pulaar, Soninke, Wolof). This historical and ongoing stratification underpins many social and human rights issues.

Slavery and its Legacy: The legacy of slavery and its continued practice (though illegal) profoundly shapes social relations, identity, and access to resources for the Haratin community. Anti-slavery activism and the government's response are central sociological themes.

Nomadic and Sedentary Lifestyles: Historically, a blend of nomadic (among some Moorish groups) and sedentary (among West African groups) lifestyles, though increasing urbanization is a significant trend (61.3% live in urban areas in 2024).

Cultural Identity: The country bridges Arab and African cultures, reflected in its languages, music, and social customs. Concerns about "forced Arabization" among Afro-Mauritanian communities highlight cultural tensions.

Migration: A transit country for migrants attempting to reach Europe, leading to complex social dynamics and humanitarian concerns related to pushbacks.

Poverty: A significant portion of the population (projected 31.8% in 2027) lives in poverty, particularly in rural areas and among vulnerable groups.
