Federal Council and Consensus-Based Governance: As of July 2025, Switzerland continues to operate under its unique system of direct democracy and consensus-based governance, with the seven-member Federal Council serving as the collective head of state and government. Karin Keller-Sutter is the current President for 2025. The Federal Council typically comprises representatives from the four largest parties: the Swiss People's Party (SVP), Social Democratic Party (SP), FDP.The Liberals (FDP), and The Centre.

Direct Democracy Initiatives: Switzerland remains the most participatory democratic country in the world. Citizens regularly vote on popular initiatives and referendums at federal, cantonal, and communal levels. This constant public engagement means policy development is a continuous process of consultation and negotiation, ensuring a high degree of citizen involvement in decision-making.

EU Relations and Bilateral Approach: Switzerland is actively engaged in stabilizing and further developing its bilateral approach with the European Union. In June 2025, the Federal Council approved a new package of agreements, protocols, and statements, opening a domestic consultation process. Key areas of cooperation include research (with full activation of transitional regulations for Horizon Europe, Euratom, and Digital Europe programs), public health, and electricity grid stability. The full package of agreements is expected to be signed in the first quarter of 2026, with an agreement on EU program participation (including Horizon Europe) due to be signed in November 2025. This complex process reflects Switzerland's desire to maintain close ties with its largest trading partner while preserving its sovereignty.

Neutrality and Geopolitical Adaptation: Switzerland's long-standing policy of neutrality is constantly adapting to evolving global conflicts and geopolitical fragmentation. While maintaining its principle of non-alignment, it participates in international efforts to promote peace and stability. The country is taking on the Chair of Eureka (a European innovation network) from July 2025 to June 2026, a role which emphasizes strengthening international research and innovation collaboration in a world marked by increasing geopolitical tensions and economic politicization. This position aims to build resilience through technological sovereignty and cross-border innovation.

Economic Outlook

Moderate Growth and Safe-Haven Status: The Swiss economy is projected to experience moderate growth in 2025, with GDP forecasts around 0.9% to 1.3% (sporting events adjusted), slightly below its long-term potential. This growth is expected to be driven by private consumption (supported by real wage increases and planned pension payment increases) and stronger construction activity due to easing monetary conditions. Switzerland continues to benefit from strong fundamentals, highly credible institutions, and a skilled labor force, cementing its position as a global safe haven.

Inflation and Monetary Policy: Headline inflation is expected to remain subdued, potentially dipping temporarily below zero before ending 2025 at around 0.1% and rising to 0.6% by end-2026. Core inflation is projected to remain within the Swiss National Bank's (SNB) 0-2% price stability range. The SNB has adopted an accommodative monetary policy, with the policy rate at zero as of July 2025, following recent rate cuts. While additional easing might be considered if deflationary pressures intensify, the SNB is mindful of the risks associated with negative rates for financial sector stability.

Labor Market: The labor market shows some softening, though unemployment rates remain near their natural level.

Fiscal Position and Financial Sector Reforms: Switzerland maintains robust public finances, with a projected budget surplus for 2025. The IMF's 2025 Article IV Consultation highlighted the need to address emerging fiscal pressures and continue strong financial sector reforms. The finalization of the Basel III standard (Basel III Final) for banks came into force on January 1, 2025, enhancing risk-sensitive capital adequacy requirements. FINMA Circular 2025/02 on "Rules of Conduct under FinSA/FinSO" also entered force, further strengthening financial market regulation. Discussions continue on strengthening international supervisory cooperation and the anti-money laundering (AML) framework, including a proposed transparency register for beneficial owners, which is not expected to enter into force before 2026 at the earliest.

Challenges: Key risks include worsening geopolitical tensions, trade fragmentation, volatile energy prices, and the impact of the strong Swiss franc on export-oriented sectors. The highly leveraged commercial real estate sector remains a domestic vulnerability, and strengthening supervisory, resolution, and crisis management frameworks in the banking sector (exposed during the Credit Suisse crisis) is a priority.

Public Administration

Digitalization of Services: The push for digitalization in public administration is gaining momentum across cantons, with a long-term goal of more efficient and transparent immigration and administrative frameworks. The Federal Department of Justice and Police has already implemented an online visa system.

Immigration Policy Updates (2025): Switzerland's immigration framework saw significant changes in 2025. Work permit quotas for Croatian nationals have been lifted as of January 1, 2025, granting them unrestricted access to the Swiss labor market (though a safeguard clause could be activated for 2026). The S-permit (for displaced Ukrainians) is under review, with proposed measures to encourage employment and facilitate job access, though its long-term future beyond February 2026 remains uncertain. The quota system for non-EU/EFTA nationals remains largely unchanged.

Fiscal Prudence: Public administration continues to emphasize fiscal prudence and efficiency in resource allocation.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Civil Law System: Switzerland operates under a civil law system.

Business and Human Rights Focus: Switzerland is a leader in business and human rights, being a founding member of the ILO and having ratified all eight ILO Core Conventions.

Combating Modern Slavery and Trafficking: While not having a single comprehensive "Modern Slavery Act," Switzerland addresses modern slavery through its criminal law (Article 182 of the Swiss Criminal Code for human trafficking) and specific due diligence obligations concerning child labor and conflict materials.

International Cooperation: Switzerland actively participates in international efforts to combat crime, including supporting UNODC initiatives on crime prevention, criminal justice, and combating human trafficking and smuggling, as demonstrated by its involvement in the 34th Session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in May 2025.

Begging Ban Debate: A special investigator recommended against a nationwide ban on begging, citing concerns about human rights, sparking ongoing debate.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Diverse Religious Landscape: Switzerland has a highly diverse religious landscape, primarily due to its historical cantonal autonomy and more recent immigration. Major groups include Roman Catholics, Protestants (primarily Swiss Reformed), and a growing number of adherents to other religions, including Islam, and those with no religious affiliation.

Secularization Trend: While historically rooted in Christian traditions, Switzerland, like many Western European countries, is experiencing a trend of secularization, with a growing number of people identifying as non-religious.

Gender Studies

High Gender Equality Ranking: Switzerland consistently ranks high in global gender equality indices.

Ongoing Initiatives: Efforts continue to promote gender equality in various spheres, including economic participation, political representation, and addressing gender-based violence. The legal and social frameworks aim to ensure equal opportunities and rights for all genders.
