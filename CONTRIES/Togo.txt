Constitutional Crisis and Widespread Protests (July 2025): Togo is currently embroiled in a significant political crisis. Recent constitutional reforms, which came into force in May 2025, have effectively abolished direct presidential elections and created the powerful role of "President of the Council of Ministers," a position now held by President Faure Gnassingbé. This new role has no official term limits, allowing him to be re-elected indefinitely by Parliament. The former position of "National President" is now largely ceremonial and held by Jean-Lucien Savi de Tové, an opposition figure, a move widely seen as an attempt to legitimize the regime transition.

This has been denounced by opposition politicians as a "constitutional coup." Widespread protests against these changes erupted in late June 2025, leading to clashes with security forces, tear gas deployment, baton charges, and reported abuses by security forces, including severe injuries and arbitrary arrests. Amnesty International has reported at least three deaths, with civil society groups claiming a total of seven fatalities. Internet access, particularly social media platforms, has been restricted intermittently.

Gnassingbé's Enduring Rule: Faure Gnassingbé has been in power since 2005, following the death of his father, Gnassingbé Eyadéma, who ruled for 38 years. The recent constitutional changes solidify his family's long hold on power, a situation that has drawn criticism and concern in a West African region grappling with a surge in military coups and threats to democracy.

Regional Context and International Scrutiny: Togo's political situation is under close scrutiny from regional bodies and international organizations. ECOWAS has been involved in discussions related to democratic transitions in the Sahel region, and the ongoing unrest in Togo raises concerns about democratic backsliding within the community. The human rights situation is particularly alarming, with consistent reports of torture and ill-treatment.

Economic Outlook

Moderate Growth Amidst Headwinds: Togo's economy is projected to maintain moderate growth in 2025, with forecasts ranging from 5.1% (World Bank) to 6.2% (Togo First, based on Q1 2025 data). This growth is driven by the dynamism of agriculture, market services, and public investment in infrastructure. However, fiscal consolidation efforts, weak global demand, and regional uncertainties, along with the current political instability, pose headwinds.

Fiscal Consolidation and Debt Management: The government is committed to fiscal consolidation, aiming to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP in 2025 (excluding bank recapitalization). This is supported by improved revenue mobilization and reduced public spending, particularly capital expenditures. Public debt remains a concern at 69.5% of GDP in 2025, but the risk of debt distress is moderate.

IMF Support: The IMF Executive Board completed its second review under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement in June 2025, allowing for a disbursement of approximately US$60.5 million. This reflects broadly satisfactory program implementation, with successes in tax and non-tax revenue mobilization. The IMF emphasizes the need for continued revenue enhancement, efficient spending, and reforms to strengthen the social safety net (including phasing out fuel subsidies).

Rising Bank Loans and Financial Inclusion: Togolese banks sharply increased lending in Q1 2025, with new loans rising by 19% year-on-year. This indicates growing confidence in the national economy and is particularly benefiting very small, small, and medium-sized enterprises (VSEs and SMEs). Microfinance institutions remain vital for providing credit to vulnerable populations, but face challenges with high risks of unpaid loans.

Inflation Under Control: Inflation is subdued, falling to 0.8% in April 2025 from 1.8% in March, primarily due to lower food prices and improved local supplies. This price stability creates favorable conditions for expanding credit.

Key Sectors and Development Projects: Agriculture and services continue to be the backbone of the economy. The World Bank's Country Partnership Framework for FY2025–2029 focuses on agricultural productivity, agro-food value chains, and improved transport and logistics infrastructure. Significant investments are also being made in the energy sector, including a 25 MWp solar photovoltaic plant in Dapaong. The proposed Togo Digital Acceleration Project aims to boost digital infrastructure, skills, and entrepreneurship.

Public Administration

Modernization and Digitalization Efforts: Togo plans to invest CFA9 billion in modernizing its public administration in 2025, primarily through the Public Administration Modernization and Capacity Building Project for Service Delivery (PMAPDS). The goal is to enhance institutional capabilities, make public services more accessible, and improve their quality through digitalization. By the end of 2025, 75% of administrative procedures are expected to be dematerialized.

Increased Public Wage Bill: The public administration wage bill is projected to reach CFA355 billion in 2025, a 10% increase from 2024, partly due to the hiring of 3,000 new civil servants.

Impact of Political Unrest: The current political instability and the focus on power consolidation may divert attention and resources from these administrative reform efforts, potentially hindering their implementation and undermining public trust in government institutions.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Civil Law System: Togo operates under a civil law system.

Widespread Human Rights Violations: The human rights situation in Togo is a grave concern, particularly in July 2025, following the constitutional changes and protests. The World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) reports a "considerable risk of torture and ill-treatment," with persistent use of torture to extract confessions or intimidate political opponents, especially during demonstrations and in police custody. Togo has been condemned multiple times by the ECOWAS Court of Justice for such practices.

Impunity and Overcrowded Prisons: Impunity for abuses remains a major issue, partly due to the absence of external police monitoring and control mechanisms. Prisons are severely overcrowded (222% occupancy level), with 70.9% of the prison population being pre-trial detainees. The separation of pre-trial prisoners from convicted ones is largely not respected. The offense of torture is rarely upheld in courts, with cases often reclassified as misdemeanors.

Recent Legal Developments:

In a rare but significant development, the Lomé Assize Court, in February 2025, for the first time rejected evidence obtained under torture during a preliminary investigation.

The new Constitution, in force since May 2025, provides for the creation of administrative courts with a Council of State, but their operability remains a challenge.

Efforts have been made to improve detention conditions for minors in Lomé and Kara, but alternatives to detention for minors are rarely used.

International Cooperation on Security: UNODC and UNICRI have conducted training in Togo on the nexus between terrorism and transnational organized crime, reflecting concerns about the spread of terrorist activity towards coastal West African countries.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Religious Diversity: Togo is religiously diverse. The largest religious groups are indigenous beliefs (Voodoo being prominent), followed by Christianity (Roman Catholicism and various Protestant denominations) and Islam.

Coexistence: There is generally a degree of religious coexistence, although traditional beliefs often intertwine with Christian and Islamic practices. The current political instability could, however, exacerbate existing social fault lines, including religious ones, if not carefully managed.

Gender Studies

Vulnerability to Violence: Women in Togo face ongoing challenges, including vulnerability to violence, particularly in the context of political protests where security forces have been accused of abuses.

Gender Disparities in Poverty: Gender disparities are recognized as contributing to poverty, and initiatives like the Sahel Women's Empowerment and Demographic Dividend Plus Project (approved September 2023) aim to improve women's access to education, economic opportunities, and health services.

Gender Budgeting: The IMF's data for 2025 indicates the presence of a "Gender Budgeting Indicator," suggesting efforts to integrate gender perspectives into fiscal planning.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Ethnic Diversity: Togo is home to numerous ethnic groups, with the Ewe and Mina being the largest in the south, and the Kabye in the north. This diversity contributes to a rich cultural tapestry.

Traditional Beliefs and Practices: Traditional beliefs and practices, including various forms of animism and ancestor worship, remain influential, often coexisting with Abrahamic religions.

Social Tensions and Political Divide: The deep political divide between the long-ruling Gnassingbé family and the opposition, fueled by socio-economic grievances and regional disparities, creates significant social tensions. The ongoing protests highlight the strong desire for political change and a more inclusive society.

Philosophy

Legitimacy of Power: The core philosophical debate in Togo currently revolves around the legitimacy of power. The constitutional changes and Gnassingbé's indefinite rule challenge democratic principles and raise questions about the social contract between the state and its citizens.

Development vs. Freedom: The government's focus on economic growth and infrastructure development often comes into tension with the suppression of political freedoms and human rights, forcing a philosophical consideration of whether development can truly be inclusive and sustainable without robust democratic governance.

Rule of Law: The repeated accusations of human rights abuses and the lack of accountability within the criminal justice system challenge the very notion of the rule of law and justice in Togo.

History

German Colony: Togo was a German protectorate (Togoland) from the late 19th century until World War I.

French and British Mandates: After WWI, it was divided into French Togoland and British Togoland under League of Nations mandates. British Togoland eventually merged with Ghana.

Independence (1960) and Eyadéma's Rule: French Togoland gained independence in 1960. In 1967, Gnassingbé Eyadéma seized power in a coup, establishing a long-standing authoritarian rule that lasted until his death in 2005.

Dynastic Succession and Ongoing Struggles: Upon Eyadéma's death, his son, Faure Gnassingbé, controversially assumed power, a move that sparked widespread protests. His rule has continued the family's control, culminating in the recent constitutional changes that further entrench his power, leading to the current crisis in July 2025. This history of dynastic rule and repeated constitutional manipulations forms the backdrop for the current unrest.

Social Work

Poverty and Inequality: Despite economic growth, poverty and inequality remain high, with an estimated poverty incidence of 45.5% in 2019 (latest data available). Social workers are crucial in addressing these disparities, particularly in rural areas.

Humanitarian Response to Unrest: The current political protests and security force abuses will undoubtedly increase the need for social work interventions, including providing support to victims of violence, those arbitrarily detained, and affected families.

Addressing Vulnerable Groups: Social workers play a role in supporting vulnerable populations, including women, youth, and children, who are particularly susceptible to the impacts of political instability and human rights abuses.

Strengthening Social Safety Nets: The IMF's emphasis on strengthening the effectiveness of social safety nets points to a key area for social work involvement and advocacy.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Restricted Media Freedom: Media freedom in Togo is significantly restricted. French media outlets France24 and RFI were suspended for three months in June 2025 due to "critical political coverage." Internet access has been restricted, and social media platforms function intermittently during protests.

Censorship and Self-Censorship: This environment leads to a high degree of censorship and self-censorship, making it difficult for citizens to access unbiased information.

Digitalization Paradox: While the government aims to digitalize public services, the concurrent restriction of internet access during times of unrest creates a paradox, highlighting the tension between technological advancement and democratic freedoms.

Education / Teaching

Improving Access and Quality: Efforts are underway to improve access to education and enhance its quality, especially in rural areas. The Sahel Women's Empowerment and Demographic Dividend Plus Project, for instance, includes improving access to education for women.

Skills Development: The World Bank emphasizes strengthening human capital development, including improving the quality of education and skill levels to support economic transformation.

Impact of Political Instability: Political instability and protests can disrupt education, leading to school closures and affecting student learning outcomes.

Library Science

Cultural Preservation: Libraries in Togo play an important role in preserving the country's diverse cultural heritage, including its oral traditions, historical records, and literature.

Access to Information and Literacy: They are vital for promoting literacy and providing access to information, especially in a country with significant literacy challenges.

Supporting Education and Research: Libraries support educational initiatives at all levels and provide resources for research, contributing to intellectual development.

Digitalization and Access: As the country moves towards digitalizing public services, libraries could potentially play a role in bridging the digital divide by providing access to digital resources and promoting digital literacy, assuming internet restrictions do not impede this progress.
