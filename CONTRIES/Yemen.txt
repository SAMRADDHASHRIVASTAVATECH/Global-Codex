Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Fragmented Governance and Enduring Conflict (July 2025): Yemen remains engulfed in a complex civil war, characterized by a fragmented political landscape. The internationally recognized government, represented by the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) led by Rashad al-Alimi, controls limited territory, primarily the south, and is heavily reliant on foreign patrons (Saudi Arabia and UAE). The Houthi movement (Ansar Allah) effectively controls the capital, Sanaa, and much of northern Yemen. The UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, continues diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled political process, emphasizing the need for an inclusive political settlement.

Red Sea Tensions and Regional Impact: While there is a state of "relative calm" on the domestic front, regional tensions, particularly in the Red Sea, significantly impact Yemen. The Houthis continue to align with Iran, indicating their willingness to resume attacks on merchant and commercial vessels if the US and its allies escalate actions against Iran. This dynamic complicates peace efforts and highlights Yemen's role in broader regional geopolitical struggles. The Security Council is expected to renew the mandate of the UN Mission to Support the Hodeidah Agreement (UNMHA) and the monthly reporting requirement on Houthi attacks in the Red Sea in July 2025.

Overdue Elections and Political Repression: Presidential and legislative elections are long overdue, and no side has been willing or able to implement an existing electoral framework. Political parties exist but face severe repression. Both the Houthi authorities and the internationally recognized government have been accused of suppressing dissent, arbitrarily detaining individuals, and hindering the work of local and international NGOs.

Economic Outlook

Deep Economic Contraction and Fragmentation: Yemen's economy continues to face severe strain. Real GDP is projected to contract by 1.5% in 2025, with nominal GDP per capita expected to drop by 19%. The country is deeply divided into two economic zones with separate institutions, monetary authorities, and exchange rates, leading to significant disparities and hindering coordinated policymaking.

Fiscal Crisis and Currency Depreciation: The government in IRG-controlled areas faces severe fiscal strain, partly due to the Houthi blockade on oil exports. The Yemeni Rial continues to depreciate rapidly (31% year-on-year in IRG areas by May 2025), eroding household purchasing power. Inflation in IRG areas exceeded 30% in 2024, while Houthi-controlled areas face deflation and liquidity constraints, increasing reliance on informal and barter-based transactions.

Humanitarian-Economic Nexus: The economic crisis directly exacerbates the humanitarian catastrophe. More than two-thirds of Yemenis face inadequate food consumption, and families are resorting to increasingly destructive coping strategies as resources are exhausted. Fuel and food imports via Red Sea ports have dropped sharply, while local fuel prices have hit record highs, further driving up food costs.

Limited Recovery Prospects: The World Bank's Spring 2025 Yemen Economic Monitor describes the economic environment as "fragile," noting that while peace is critical for long-term recovery, actions can be taken to reduce immediate economic pressures. Declining donor financing and sanctions compliance risks continue to constrain economic activity.

Public Administration

Dysfunctional State Institutions: Yemen lacks a functioning central government with full control over its territory. State institutions, where they exist, are often controlled by unelected officials and armed groups, leading to limited transparency and accountability.

Impeded Service Delivery: Public services are severely impacted by the conflict and lack of unified governance. Basic services like water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), health, and education are crumbling, with millions lacking access. Humanitarian organizations face significant challenges in delivering aid, including restrictions imposed by de-facto authorities.

Local Administration Challenges: While there are efforts by humanitarian organizations to support local institutions and service delivery, the overall fragmentation and lack of resources severely hamper effective public administration across the country.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Human Rights Catastrophe: The criminal justice system in both Houthi and IRG-controlled areas is severely compromised. Human rights organizations continue to report widespread violations, including arbitrary arrests, forced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings. Impunity for perpetrators is the norm.

Suppression of Dissent: Freedom of expression, assembly, and association are severely restricted. Journalists, activists, and perceived opponents face targeted harassment, detention, and politically motivated charges. The detention of over 60 UN and NGO employees by Houthi authorities in May and June 2024 (and continued custody) exemplifies the dangers faced by those operating independently.

Lack of Due Process: Judicial processes are often flawed, lacking adherence to international standards of due process. This further undermines the rule of law and compounds the human rights crisis.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Predominantly Muslim: Yemen's population is almost entirely Muslim, with the majority being Sunni (primarily Shafi'i school) and a significant minority being Zaydi Shia, particularly in the northern highlands where the Houthi movement originated.

Sectarian Tensions: While traditionally coexistential, the ongoing conflict has exacerbated sectarian tensions, particularly between the Zaydi Houthis and Sunni-majority populations and groups. Religious identity has been politicized and used as a mobilizing factor in the conflict.

Religious Practices: Traditional Islamic holidays are widely celebrated, including Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr. Shi'a Muslims observe Ashura.

Gender Studies

Disproportionate Impact on Women and Girls: Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the conflict and humanitarian crisis. They face heightened risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child marriage, and child labor. Access to basic services, including healthcare and education, is severely limited for them.

Limited Political Participation: While there were some historical efforts to include women in political processes (e.g., 30% of delegates in the National Dialogue Conference were women), their political rights and electoral opportunities have been significantly eroded due to the conflict and the absence of functioning democratic institutions. No women were appointed to the PLC in 2022.

Protection Needs: Women and girls require urgent protection services, as outlined in the 2025 Humanitarian Response Plan, including interventions to mitigate and prevent GBV.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Tribal Society: Yemeni society is traditionally tribally based, with strong emphasis on family and clan loyalties. This tribal structure has both contributed to resilience and, at times, fueled internal conflict.

Mass Displacement and Food Insecurity: The war has led to one of the world's largest internal displacement crises, with over 4.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs). More than two-thirds of Yemenis face inadequate food consumption, and coping strategies are increasingly destructive.

Child Protection Crisis: Children are facing an alarming protection crisis, with widespread child labor, child marriage, and recruitment by armed groups. Millions are out of school, and mental health issues are prevalent due to years of conflict and trauma.

Cultural Heritage at Risk: The ongoing conflict poses a severe threat to Yemen's rich cultural heritage and ancient sites.

Philosophy

Survival and Resilience: The dominant philosophical theme for the Yemeni people is survival amidst unprecedented hardship. Despite the conflict, there is an underlying resilience and reliance on community and traditional support systems.

Fragmented Identities: The war has deepened divisions, leading to fragmented identities (tribal, regional, sectarian) that often overshadow a unified national identity.

Justice and Accountability: For many, the philosophical quest is for justice and accountability for the widespread human rights violations and the devastating impact of the conflict, as well as a pathway to a lasting and inclusive peace.

History

Ancient Civilizations: Yemen boasts a rich ancient history, home to advanced civilizations like the Sabaean kingdom (Sheba), known for its trade routes and sophisticated irrigation systems (e.g., Marib Dam).

Ottoman and British Rule: In more recent history, Yemen was divided into two parts under Ottoman (north) and British (south) control until the mid-20th century.

Unification and Civil Wars: North and South Yemen unified in 1990, but this was followed by a civil war in 1994. The country has a history of internal conflicts and political instability.

Post-2014 Conflict: The current conflict escalated in 2014 when the Houthi movement seized Sanaa, leading to the intervention of a Saudi-led coalition in 2015 in support of the internationally recognized government. This decade-long conflict has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

Social Work

Humanitarian Aid Coordination: Social workers are integral to the humanitarian response, focusing on providing life-saving assistance, protection, and basic services to the 19.5 million people in need (2025 projection).

Addressing Vulnerabilities: A primary focus is on the most vulnerable groups: IDPs, women and girls (especially those at risk of GBV), children (due to malnutrition, lack of education, and recruitment), and people with disabilities.

Mental Health and Psychosocial Support: Given the widespread trauma, social workers provide critical mental health and psychosocial support services.

Limited Operational Space and Funding: Social workers operate in an extremely challenging environment marked by insecurity, restricted humanitarian access, and severe funding shortages for the 2025 Humanitarian Response Plan (only 10.9% funded as of July 2025).

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Severely Restricted and Politicized Media: Media freedom in Yemen is severely curtailed. Media outlets are largely controlled by the warring parties or operate under extreme pressure, leading to self-censorship and widespread bias.

Dangerous Environment for Journalists: Journalists face immense risks, including arbitrary detention, threats, and violence from all sides of the conflict. Access to independent and reliable information is extremely limited for the general population.

Information Blackouts: Both Houthi and IRG authorities have allegedly withheld public health data, further hindering transparency and effective communication during crises.

Education / Teaching

Collapsed Education System: The education system in Yemen has been devastated by the conflict. Millions of children are out of school (estimated 4.5 million in 2025), and thousands of schools have been damaged or destroyed.

Teacher Shortages and Overburdened Facilities: Many teachers are unpaid or severely underpaid, leading to high dropout rates. Functioning schools are often overcrowded with unequipped teachers.

Impact of Displacement: IDP children face particular challenges in accessing education, further exacerbating the learning crisis.

Long-Term Consequences: The disruption of education has severe long-term consequences for human capital development and future recovery.

Library Science

Cultural Heritage at Risk: Libraries and other cultural institutions in Yemen face immense threats from the ongoing conflict, including damage, destruction, and looting of valuable collections and historical documents.

Limited Access to Resources: Economic collapse and lack of infrastructure hinder the functioning of libraries, limiting public access to information and educational resources.

Preservation Efforts: International efforts may be underway to document and preserve Yemen's unique cultural heritage, including its literary and archival collections, given the current risks.
