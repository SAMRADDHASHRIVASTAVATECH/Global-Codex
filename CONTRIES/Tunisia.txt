Democratic Backsliding and Presidential Rule (July 2025): Tunisia, once seen as the sole democratic success of the Arab Spring, is experiencing a drastic closure of its civic space under President Kais Saied. Following a constitutional referendum in 2022 that granted him near unchecked power, Saied was re-elected in October 2024 with 90.69% of the vote amidst a voter turnout of 28.8%. Human Rights Watch's World Report 2025 highlights intensified repression leading up to this election, with politically motivated arrests and arbitrary detentions of prospective challengers, activists, lawyers, journalists, human rights defenders, and social media users.

The President has systematically undermined judicial independence and used the judiciary to target critics. Legislative changes, such as stripping the Administrative Court of jurisdiction in electoral matters, further centralize power.

International Scrutiny and EU Relations: Tunisia's democratic backsliding has drawn significant international criticism. The UN Human Rights Office, in February 2025, called for an end to the pattern of arrests and arbitrary detentions. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have condemned the crackdown.

Despite these concerns, the European Union has continued to engage with Tunisia on migration control, a policy criticized by human rights organizations for neglecting ongoing human rights violations. Some argue that the EU's focus on stemming irregular migration has led to an "abandonment of human rights priorities" in its relations with Tunisia.

Regional Instability and Security Concerns: Tunisia is situated in a region facing ongoing instability, which influences its foreign policy and security concerns. The government continues to cooperate on counter-terrorism efforts, with a focus on preventing the flow of foreign fighters and addressing organized crime.

Economic Outlook

Modest Growth Amidst Structural Challenges: Tunisia's economy is projected to experience modest growth in 2025. The World Bank forecasts a 1.9% growth rate for 2025, up from 1.4% in 2024, driven by improved rainfall and stabilization in key sectors like tourism and agriculture. The EBRD forecasts 1.8% growth, while the IMF projects 2.4%.

Fiscal Pressures and Public Debt: The country faces significant fiscal challenges. Domestic financing needs are estimated at $6.8 billion in 2025, a substantial increase from 2024, and external borrowing plans have been halved. Public debt remains high, leading to pressure on public finances, including debt servicing and public sector salary payments. The government's high borrowing also crowds out private sector activity.

Inflation Deceleration: Inflation has been decelerating in early 2025, falling to 5.6% in April—the lowest since 2021—and nearing pre-pandemic averages. Food inflation stands at 7.3%. In response, the Central Bank of Tunisia reduced its key interest rate to 7.5% in May, its first cut in over two years.

Tourism as a Key Sector: Tourism remains a vital contributor to the economy, with projections for significant revenue generation and employment.

Trade Deficit and Connectivity: The trade deficit widened in Q1 2025 due to increased energy imports and a slowdown in export volumes, despite resilient tourism receipts and improving terms of trade. The World Bank highlights the significant economic potential of improving Tunisia's port system, estimating that enhanced port connectivity could boost GDP by 4–5% within three to four years.

Informal Economy and FDI: The informal economy is estimated to constitute a large burden on state coffers (40-60% of total). While Tunisia attracts Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) due to its strategic location and free trade agreements, weaknesses like nepotism, regional imbalances, and restrictive customs/tax regimes disincentivize some investment, especially for SMEs.

Public Administration

Centralization of Power: President Saied's consolidation of power has impacted public administration. While efforts to streamline bureaucratic procedures for investment have been noted, the erosion of judicial independence and the crackdown on civil society may hinder transparency and accountability in governance.

Justice Sector Reforms: A new law adopted in July 2024 (and thus effective in 2025) introduced important reforms related to issuing checks, paving the way for the release of hundreds of people imprisoned solely for check-related debts. This indicates some reform efforts within the justice system, though broader concerns about its independence persist.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Erosion of Judicial Independence: President Saied's government has systematically undermined judicial independence, targeting judges and using the judiciary to serve political ends. The African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights has ordered the suspension of presidential decrees that gave the president authority to dismiss magistrates.

Crackdown on Dissent and Arbitrary Detentions: There is an alarming pattern of arrests, arbitrary detentions, and imprisonment of political opponents, activists, lawyers, journalists, and human rights defenders. Many are held in pre-trial detention facing broad and vague accusations, raising concerns about violations of freedom of expression and fair trial rights.

Examples include the "Instalingo" case in February 2025, where 41 individuals, including politicians, journalists, and bloggers, received lengthy prison sentences (5 to 54 years) on charges of "plotting conspiracy" against state security.

In May 2025, Amnesty International reported that human rights defenders assisting refugees and migrants have been held in arbitrary pre-trial detention for over a year.

As of June 30, 2025, prominent lawyer and critic of President Saied, Sonia Dahmani, was sentenced to two years in jail under the controversial cybercrime law (Decree 54) for statements critical of the government's practices against refugees and migrants.

Refugee and Migrant Rights: Security forces continue to abuse migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees with impunity. In April 2025, authorities launched large-scale operations to dismantle informal migrant camps, displacing thousands. Forced evictions and unlawful collective expulsions of refugees and migrants to Libya and Algeria are also reported.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Predominantly Sunni Muslim: Tunisia is overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. Islam is the state religion, and the government plays a role in managing religious institutions.

Religious Tolerance (within limits): While the constitution declares Islam as the state religion, it also guarantees freedom of conscience and worship. Other religious minorities exist, and generally practice their faith without major interference, though public expression of non-Islamic beliefs can sometimes be sensitive.

Gender Studies

Women's Rights Under Threat: While Tunisia has historically been a leader in women's rights in the region, particularly after the 2011 revolution, the current political climate poses a threat. The broader crackdown on civil society and freedom of expression disproportionately affects women activists, journalists, and lawyers.

Gender Mainstreaming: While not explicitly detailed for 2025, the presence of a "Gender Budgeting Indicator" in IMF data suggests some formal commitment to integrating gender perspectives into fiscal planning. However, the overall human rights regression is likely to impact progress on gender equality.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Arab and Amazigh Identity: Tunisian identity is predominantly Arab, with a significant Amazigh (Berber) minority. The culture is a blend of indigenous, Arab, and historical influences from Phoenician, Roman, and Ottoman civilizations.

Social Discontent and Migration: Persistent economic hardship, including high public debt and inflation, has fueled social discontent. The dire economic situation and limited opportunities contribute to significant outward migration, often through dangerous irregular channels across the Mediterranean.

Xenophobia and Migrant Treatment: There has been an increase in xenophobia and racism, particularly targeting sub-Saharan African migrants. The crackdown on NGOs providing aid to migrants, combined with forced expulsions, reflects a concerning social and political climate for non-Tunisian Africans.

Philosophy

Rule of Law vs. Executive Power: The central philosophical conflict in Tunisia is the erosion of the rule of law and democratic principles in favor of concentrated executive power. President Saied's actions challenge the very definition of a constitutional republic and raise fundamental questions about justice, accountability, and citizen rights.

Sovereignty and Human Rights: The government's narrative often emphasizes national sovereignty and internal affairs, even when faced with international condemnation for human rights abuses, creating a philosophical tension between state autonomy and universal human rights.

Economic Justice and Social Contract: The ongoing economic crisis and high unemployment question the effectiveness of the social contract between the state and its citizens, raising philosophical debates about economic justice, equitable distribution of resources, and the state's responsibility to its people.

History

Ancient Civilizations (Carthage): Tunisia has a rich ancient history, notably as the home of Carthage, a powerful Phoenician city-state that rivaled Rome.

Arab Conquest and Ottoman Rule: Following the Arab conquest in the 7th century, Islam and Arab culture became dominant. It later became part of the Ottoman Empire.

French Protectorate: From 1881 to 1956, Tunisia was a French protectorate.

Independence (1956) and Bourguiba's Rule: Gained independence in 1956 under Habib Bourguiba, who established a secular, one-party state.

Ben Ali Era: Zine El Abidine Ben Ali took power in a bloodless coup in 1987, maintaining an authoritarian regime until 2011.

Arab Spring and Democratic Transition (2011-2021): The "Arab Spring" began in Tunisia in December 2010, leading to Ben Ali's overthrow in January 2011. This ushered in a decade of democratic transition, with a new constitution and free elections, widely hailed as a regional success story.

Saied's Power Grab (2021-Present): In July 2021, President Kais Saied dismissed the government, dissolved parliament, and began ruling by decree, effectively dismantling the democratic system. The 2022 constitutional referendum and his 2024 re-election cemented his centralized power, marking a significant backsliding from the post-2011 democratic gains.

Social Work

Addressing Socio-Economic Hardship: Social workers are at the forefront of assisting individuals and families grappling with high public debt, inflation, and unemployment, which affect economic, social, and cultural rights.

Migrant and Refugee Support (Challenging Environment): Despite the government crackdown, social workers, often through NGOs, continue to provide vital aid and support to vulnerable migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees, who face forced evictions, expulsions, and abuse. This work is increasingly challenging due to the criminalization of humanitarian efforts.

Human Rights Advocacy: Given the escalating human rights crisis, social workers are increasingly involved in advocacy, documenting abuses, and supporting victims of arbitrary detention and political persecution.

Community Resilience: Efforts to build community resilience in the face of political and economic instability, as well as addressing issues like xenophobia, are crucial areas for social work intervention.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Severe Restrictions on Media Freedom: Media freedom in Tunisia has severely deteriorated. Human Rights Watch's World Report 2025 states that authorities have drastically curtailed freedom of expression and the press, targeting journalists and media outlets critical of the president.

Cybercrime Law (Decree 54): The controversial Decree-Law 54 on Cybercrime is frequently used to prosecute journalists, lawyers, and critics for "spreading fake news" or "conspiracy." The two-year prison sentence for lawyer Sonia Dahmani in June 2025 is a recent example.

Online Harassment and Disinformation: The digital space is likely to be characterized by increased online harassment and government-aligned disinformation, further limiting independent journalism and free expression.

Education / Teaching

Impact of Economic Crisis: The ongoing economic crisis and fiscal pressures are likely to impact public spending on education, potentially affecting quality and access, especially in rural or underserved areas.

Brain Drain: Economic hardships and limited opportunities might contribute to a "brain drain," where educated youth seek opportunities abroad, posing a long-term challenge for the education sector.

Curriculum and Ideology: The centralized political control might influence educational curricula, potentially favoring a state-centric narrative and limiting critical thinking.

Library Science

Preserving National Heritage: Libraries in Tunisia play a vital role in preserving the country's rich historical and cultural heritage, including ancient manuscripts, Islamic texts, and modern literary works, reflecting its diverse influences.

Access to Information (Challenged): While libraries generally aim to provide public access to information and promote literacy, the current climate of curtailed freedom of expression and the crackdown on critical voices might indirectly affect the range of materials available or the willingness of individuals to access certain information.

Digitalization Efforts: Libraries are likely engaged in digitalization efforts to preserve and disseminate knowledge, making resources more accessible to a wider audience, though internet censorship or restrictions could pose challenges.

Supporting Research (Limited by Climate): Libraries traditionally support academic and public research, but the suppression of dissent and limitations on academic freedom may impact the scope and nature of research undertaken.
