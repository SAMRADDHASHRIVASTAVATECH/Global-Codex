Social Hierarchy & Discrimination:
Caste-like social stratification persists. Racial identity shapes access to power, land, education, and opportunity.

Arab and African identities coexist—but state policies (e.g., Arabic-only education) are viewed by some as forced Arabization and cultural erasure.

Urbanization:
61.3% of the population lived in urban areas by 2024, signaling growing shifts from traditional nomadic lifestyles.

Migration Dynamics:
Mauritania is a transit hub for West African migrants heading to Europe. EU-backed pushbacks are reshaping community relations.

Philosophy
Islamic Jurisprudence and Ethics:
Islam shapes societal values, conceptions of justice, and national identity.

Sovereignty & Security Philosophy:
The state prioritizes sovereignty, internal order, and anti-terrorism—sometimes at the cost of civil liberties.

Justice vs. Practice Gap:
Ongoing disconnect between legal abolition of slavery and its real-life persistence reflects a deep philosophical challenge about justice, rights, and societal transformation.

Mauritania sat at the heart of trans-Saharan trade networks and early Islamic scholarship.

Colonial Legacy:
Under French control as part of French West Africa from the late 1800s to independence in 1960.

Social workers are increasingly engaged in resilience-building programs in drought-affected areas.

Migration & Refugees:
Assisting expelled or in-transit migrants remains a key function, especially amid rising EU-funded deportations.

Digital platforms play a growing role in anti-slavery advocacy and grassroots awareness—though often under surveillance.

Education / Teaching
