üèõÔ∏è Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies
System: Constitutional multi-party democracy with a presidential system.

2025 elections scheduled for September; current political environment marked by pre-election tension and growing public frustration.

Political Landscape:

Democratic institutions functional, but public trust declining due to corruption, economic hardship, and insecurity.

June 2025 attack on peaceful protesters in Lilongwe raises concern over erosion of democratic space and state complicity in suppression.

Strategic Focus (ATMM Agenda):

Diversification through Agriculture, Tourism, Mining, and Manufacturing.

Structural reforms required to manage fiscal imbalances and reduce donor dependency.

International Relations:

Donor Dependence: USAID suspension of $350M aid (13% of national budget) has strained service delivery and budget execution.

IMF & Debt Restructuring: IMF pressure on fiscal consolidation, exchange rate reform, and debt restructuring as prerequisites for future disbursements.

Regional Role: SADC member with limited regional influence due to internal constraints.

üìâ Economic Outlook
GDP:

Projected to grow by 2.4% (2025), with uncertainty based on agriculture output and donor engagement.

Poverty & Informality:

Over 70% of the population lives under $2.15/day.

Informal sector comprises 68% of jobs ‚Äî largely unprotected, unregulated.

Inflation:

Among Africa‚Äôs highest: ~29% in 2025, driven by food prices, monetary expansion, and forex mismatch.

Food inflation particularly acute due to maize dependence and erratic rains.

External Imbalances:

Current account deficit ~22% of GDP.

Foreign exchange shortage persists despite the 2025 Foreign Exchange Bill shift from control to management.

Debt:

~93% of GDP; 42% of govt revenue goes to debt service.

Debt restructuring crucial for macroeconomic space.

Key Risks:

Climate volatility, low productivity, weak industrial base, and over-reliance on aid and rain-fed farming.

üè¢ Public Administration
Governance Issues:

Anti-corruption strategies exist, but enforcement is weak.

Weak oversight of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).

Fiscal Strain:

Massive deficits, declining domestic revenue, and external aid volatility threaten service delivery and capital investment.

Service Delivery Failures:

USAID aid suspension has directly affected health, education, and social protection programs.

Reform Priorities:

Revenue mobilization, budget transparency, and public sector accountability remain key reform themes.

‚öñÔ∏è Criminal Justice / Legal Studies / Human Rights
Legal Framework:

Common law system with constitutionally protected rights.

Judiciary functionally independent but under-resourced.

Human Rights Concerns:

Freedom of Assembly under attack:

June 26, 2025: Violent crackdown on protesters, with police inaction suggesting state complicity.

LGBTI+ Rights:

Criminalization upheld in June 2025, risking persecution and organizational shutdowns.

Older Persons:

Witchcraft-related violence remains a major issue. Legal reforms (Older Persons Bill 2024) still non-compliant with international standards.

Girls‚Äô Education:

High dropout rates due to child marriage and pregnancy, despite protective laws and re-enrollment policies.

Health Rights:

Healthcare spending below Abuja target (12% vs. 15%). Weak infrastructure, low access to quality care.

Police Accountability:

Recent abuses highlight systemic impunity and lack of oversight.

‚õ™ Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies
Religious Composition:

Majority Christian (Protestant and Catholic), with a significant Muslim minority and indigenous spiritual practices.

Religious Influence:

Churches play key roles in education, healthcare, advocacy, and social cohesion.

Belief in witchcraft remains deeply embedded, contributing to elder abuse.

Religious Freedom:

Largely respected, though traditional beliefs can clash with constitutional rights.

üö∫ Gender Studies
Women‚Äôs Rights:

Child marriage, teen pregnancy, and GBV are systemic challenges. Laws exist but weakly enforced.

Economic Inequality:

Women overrepresented in informal and subsistence sectors. Underrepresented in leadership and formal jobs.

Climate Impacts:

Women and girls walk long distances for water, face risks of assault, and are last to eat during shortages.

Political Participation:

Some improvements in women‚Äôs leadership, but barriers remain.

üß¨ Anthropology / Sociology / Indigenous Studies / Cultural Studies
Cultural Identity:

Rooted in strong ethnic diversity, Chichewa as official language.

Rural communities preserve customs, oral histories, communal solidarity.

Social Dynamics:

Food insecurity, informal employment, and climate migration are reshaping household and gender roles.

Youth bulge: Median age ~17; demographic dividend untapped due to education and job mismatch.

Belief Systems:

Witchcraft-related violence targeting elders is a serious sociocultural and rights issue.

Social Coping Strategies:

Households engage in labor migration, early marriage, and asset sales during crisis periods.

üß† Philosophy
Core Values:

Ubuntu-like social solidarity, emphasis on resilience, communal harmony, and faith-based perseverance.

Democracy vs Delivery:

Growing dissonance between aspiration for democratic governance and its inability to alleviate hardship.

Development Philosophy:

Internal debate over self-reliance vs. donor aid.

Tensions between traditional values and modern human rights frameworks (e.g., LGBTI+ rights, girls‚Äô education).

üï∞Ô∏è History
Pre-Colonial:

Maravi Confederacy was a dominant kingdom; gave the country its name.

Colonial Era:

British protectorate (Nyasaland); part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (1953‚Äì1963).

Independence:

Achieved in 1964 under Hastings Banda, who ruled autocratically until 1994.

Democratic Transition:

1994: First multiparty elections. Gains in judicial independence and civic freedoms.

üì∞ Journalism / Media / Communication
Media Environment:

Comparatively open but at risk. Pre-election violence and lack of police protection for dissent stifle open discourse.

Disinformation:

Rising in the run-up to elections; government narratives dominate state media.

Digital Divide:

Significant urban‚Äìrural gap in access to internet and digital tools.

Civil Society Advocacy:

Media and NGOs use platforms to highlight human rights, corruption, and climate resilience.

Disruption from Climate Shocks:

Cyclones, droughts cause school closures and learning loss.

Skills Development Gaps:

Mismatch between school outcomes and labor market needs in ATMM sectors.

üìñ Library Science
Information Equity:

Libraries bridge access gaps in rural and under-resourced schools.

Preservation Role:

Important in documenting Malawian oral history, traditional knowledge, and climate adaptation strategies.

Community Literacy Hubs:

Potential centers for adult education, youth programs, and digital literacy.

Challenges:

Underfunded, often lacking in digital resources and trained librarians.
