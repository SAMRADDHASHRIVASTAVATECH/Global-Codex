New Leadership and Ambitious Reforms: As of July 2025, Vietnam is under the leadership of General Secretary To Lam, who assumed the top position of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) in July 2024 following the death of Nguyen Phu Trong. Lam, formerly the Minister of Public Security, has wasted no time in implementing significant institutional reforms and streamlining the party-state apparatus. Working closely with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, the aim is to create a "leaner, more compact, stronger, more efficient, effective, and impactful" political system by the 14th Party Congress in January 2026.

Constitutional and Administrative Overhaul: A major constitutional reform is underway in 2025. In April 2025, the Party adopted a resolution for comprehensive reform of the political system, including significant changes to local governance. On May 6, 2025, the National Assembly (NA) officially initiated the constitutional amendment process, with a draft proposing amendments to eight articles, notably establishing a two-tier structure of local government by eliminating the district level. This aims to enhance state effectiveness and reduce overlapping functions. As of July 1, 2025, Vietnam officially implemented this two-tier local administration model nationwide, comprising the provincial and commune levels.

Government Restructuring and Job Cuts: This "administrative revolution" also involves a radical consolidation of provinces and major cities, reducing the number of provincial-level administrative units from 63 to 34 by the end of 2025. It also includes merging ministries (e.g., Ministry of Planning and Investment into Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport with Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development with Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment) and a planned reduction of approximately 79,339 officials and public employees, and 120,000 part-time workers at the commune level by 2030, aiming to cut costs and boost efficiency.

Foreign Policy: Vietnam continues its decades-long multidirectional foreign policy. Under To Lam, Vietnam has elevated countries like France and Malaysia to "comprehensive strategic partners," expanding its diplomatic reach. The country remains engaged in multilateral forums and seeks to strengthen economic cooperation, as evidenced by its observer status at the EAEU Summit in June 2025 and ongoing efforts to integrate Afghanistan economically through projects like the Trans-Afghan Railway.

Human Rights Concerns Persist: Despite economic and administrative reforms, human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch report that Vietnam continues to suppress citizens' basic rights to freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, movement, and religion. Independent labor unions, human rights organizations, independent media, and political parties remain prohibited. The judiciary is not independent, and courts routinely deny defendants their due process rights.

Economic Outlook

Robust Growth with Global Headwinds (July 2025): Vietnam's economy started 2025 strongly, with 6.93% GDP growth in Q1 2025. However, the overall outlook for 2025 is more challenging due to global trade tensions and policy uncertainties. The IMF projects growth to slow to 5.4% in 2025 if high tariffs take effect in Q3, while the OECD forecasts 6.2%. Despite these downward revisions, Vietnam remains among the economies with the most positive prospects in the region.

Key Growth Drivers: Growth is driven by robust exports, resilient foreign direct investment (FDI) – which has continued to increase since mid-2024 – and strong domestic demand, particularly private consumption and public investment. The manufacturing sector remains a key contributor.

Inflation and Monetary Policy: Inflation remains contained, with an OECD projection of 3.1% in April 2025. The State Bank of Vietnam has maintained an expansionary monetary policy, including rate cuts and credit growth targets, though vigilance is needed for potential inflation pressure from planned hikes in pensions and minimum wages.

Fiscal Policy: Fiscal policy is expected to continue supporting growth through accelerated public investment, particularly in energy, logistics, and transport infrastructure. The government's planned reforms are expected to lead to significant savings (over VND190 trillion, or $7.3 billion, in 2026–2030).

Challenges and Risks: Elevated global uncertainty on trade policies (especially with potential US import tariff increases), tightening global financial conditions, and potential domestic financial stress from high corporate indebtedness pose downside risks. The collapse of the national airline, Air Vietnam, in May 2025, also highlights some domestic economic vulnerabilities.

Public Administration

Revolutionary Restructuring: Public administration is undergoing its most significant overhaul since the Đổi Mới reforms of 1986. The core of this "revolution" is the two-tier local administration model (provincial and communal levels, effective July 1, 2025) and the elimination of the district level. This is accompanied by mergers of ministries and a large-scale reduction of government jobs (estimated 20-30% by 2030) to increase efficiency and reduce bureaucracy.

Decentralization and Efficiency: The reforms aim to reduce functional overlaps, clarify roles across government levels, and delegate authority to localities for quicker decision-making. Cities serving as provincial administrative centers will be reorganized into wards, and smaller communes will be merged.

Digital Transformation: The government emphasizes a technology-driven economy and a competent public administration. Resolution No. 57 calls for removing barriers to "science, technology, innovation, and digital transformation," with every state agency required to report restructuring plans by March 2025 and new indicators to evaluate implementation.

Economic Goals: The administrative reforms are directly linked to economic objectives, aiming to limit unnecessary government intervention, ease economic activities, and strengthen public trust through effective state institutions.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Lack of Judicial Independence: The judiciary in Vietnam is not independent and operates under the strict control of the Communist Party. Courts routinely deny defendants their due process rights.

Suppression of Dissent: The criminal justice system is used to suppress free speech and civil society. Authorities continue to target independent activists, journalists, and human rights defenders with unfounded criminal charges such as "propaganda" or "infringing on the interests" of the state, leading to long prison sentences.

Restrictions on Association and Assembly: Independent labor unions, human rights organizations, and political parties remain prohibited.

Travel Restrictions: Activists, bloggers, and their families are systematically blocked from domestic and international travel, often denied passports or stopped at borders, and are routinely placed under house arrest during politically sensitive events.

Police Crackdowns: The Ministry of Public Security, under the new General Secretary To Lam, has a history of imprisoning critics and continues to be a key tool in maintaining state control.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

State Control and Restrictions: While the constitution guarantees religious freedom, the government maintains tight control over religious practices and institutions. Religious groups must be approved and registered with the government and operate under government-controlled management boards.

"Evil Religions" Label: Religious groups not recognized by the government are labeled "evil religions" (ta dao) and face harassment, intimidation, intrusive surveillance, forced renunciation of faith, pretrial detention, interrogation, torture, and imprisonment.

Concerns from Human Rights Bodies: Vietnam rejected recommendations at its Universal Periodic Review to end forced renunciation of faith for members of unregistered religious groups.

Gender Studies

Commitment to Gender Equality: Vietnam states its commitment to promoting gender equality and women's empowerment, particularly as a candidate for the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) for 2023-2025.

Challenges in Political Representation: While there have been efforts to increase female political representation (e.g., a 40% gender quota for candidates in the 2019 parliamentary elections resulted in 57 women MPs), real progress in breaking traditional gender roles and achieving true equality across all sectors remains a challenge.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

"Socialist-Oriented Market Economy": Vietnamese society is shaped by the ongoing transition from a centrally planned economy to a "socialist-oriented market economy," reflecting efforts to align with global market standards while maintaining the state's pivotal economic role.

Cultural Preservation: Despite modernization, there is a strong emphasis on preserving Vietnamese cultural identity, including traditional festivals and arts.

Youth and Demographic Shifts: Vietnam has a young population, and social policies are increasingly focused on addressing the needs of its growing workforce and managing urbanization.

Environmental Awareness: The designation of 2025 as the "Year of Environmental Protection and the Green Economy" indicates a growing societal awareness and government focus on sustainability, green development, and addressing climate change impacts.

Philosophy

Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought: The dominant philosophical framework remains Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought, which underpin the Communist Party's ideology and guide state policies.

Pragmatic Development: While ideologically rooted, the current leadership demonstrates a pragmatic approach to governance, prioritizing economic growth and administrative efficiency as key to maintaining the Party's legitimacy and the nation's "rise."

Balancing Control and Progress: There is an ongoing philosophical tension between maintaining tight political and ideological control (especially in terms of civil liberties) and pursuing rapid economic modernization and global integration.

"Building While Running": The new leadership's motto of "trying to build while running" reflects a pragmatic and swift approach to institutional reforms, emphasizing rapid implementation to achieve goals before the next Party Congress.

History

Long History of Independence and Resistance: Vietnam has a rich history marked by centuries of resistance against foreign domination (Chinese, French, American).

Đổi Mới Reforms (1986): The "Đổi Mới" (Renovation) economic reforms, initiated in 1986, marked a shift from a centrally planned economy to a more market-oriented one, leading to significant economic growth.

Recent Leadership Transition (2024-2025): A significant historical event in recent times is the death of long-time General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong in July 2024 and the subsequent ascension of To Lam, signaling a new era of intensified administrative and political reforms.

Constitutional Amendments (2025): The approval of constitutional amendments and the radical administrative restructuring in 2025 are historic shifts in Vietnam's governance structure, the biggest since the Đổi Mới reforms.

Social Work

Poverty Reduction and Welfare: Social work continues to focus on poverty reduction, particularly given the government's aim to restructure the welfare system and introduce new economic support policies.

Community Development: Social workers are involved in community-level development, particularly with the shift to a two-tier administrative structure and increased autonomy at the commune level.

Addressing Social Disparities: Efforts are ongoing to address social disparities, including access to essential services like education and healthcare, and to improve living standards across different regions.

Limited Civil Society Space: The restricted environment for independent civil society organizations may pose challenges for the full scope and advocacy of social work initiatives.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

State-Controlled Media: The media landscape in Vietnam remains under tight state control. The Communist Party of Vietnam exerts significant influence over all forms of media.

Suppression of Independent Voices: Independent journalism is severely restricted, and critical reporting often leads to intimidation, arrests, and imprisonment of journalists and bloggers on charges related to national security or "propaganda."

Digital Surveillance: Authorities actively monitor the internet and use it to identify and suppress voices deemed threatening to the Party's monopoly on power.

Propaganda and Public Information: State media plays a crucial role in disseminating government policies, promoting national development goals, and shaping public opinion.

Education / Teaching

Investment in Human Capital: Education is recognized as crucial for Vietnam's economic development and technological upgrading. The government aims to boost productivity, strengthen governance, and improve the business environment through human capital development.

Curriculum Reforms: Efforts are likely ongoing to modernize education curricula to meet the demands of a fast-growing, technology-driven economy, including a focus on science, technology, innovation, and digital transformation.

Addressing Systemic Issues: The administrative reforms, including the streamlining of government agencies, may also impact the administration of the education system, aiming for greater efficiency.

Library Science

Information Access and Literacy: Libraries in Vietnam play a role in promoting information access and literacy, supporting the nation's development goals and educational initiatives.

Digitalization: As Vietnam embraces digital transformation, libraries are likely engaged in efforts to digitize collections, improve online access to resources, and enhance digital literacy skills among the population.

Cultural Preservation: Libraries contribute to the preservation of Vietnam's rich cultural and historical heritage, making it accessible to the public.

Conference Participation: Opportunities for professional development in library science are available, with "Upcoming Library Conferences in Vietnam 2025" indicating ongoing engagement with global trends and research in the field.
