Political Science / International Relations / International Affairs / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies
New Administration (2024):
Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo (Morena) became Mexico’s first female president in December 2024. Her presidency continues the "Fourth Transformation" (4T) agenda initiated by AMLO — focusing on social justice, state-centric governance, and national sovereignty.

Democratic Backsliding:
Morena's supermajority in Congress raises alarm about weakened checks and balances. The judiciary, media, and electoral institutions face increasing pressure, with opposition voices marginalized.

Judicial Reform (2025):
The proposed electoral system for judges, including Supreme Court justices, undermines judicial independence. The reform includes popular voting, disciplinary tribunals, and “faceless” judges for cartel-related cases — raising due process concerns.

Autonomous Bodies Under Threat:
Independent institutions (e.g., transparency, electoral, and regulatory bodies) are being weakened or dismantled, centralizing executive control.

Foreign Relations & Sovereignty:
Mexico’s foreign policy emphasizes non-intervention, especially in response to U.S. discourse on labeling cartels as terrorist organizations. Reforms strengthen sovereignty and criminalize arms trafficking (mainly from the U.S.).

Migration Crisis Management:
Mexico remains key in U.S. border management, but faces rising humanitarian criticism for militarized migration control and human rights violations.

Economic Outlook
GDP Growth (2025):
Growth projections vary:

Vanguard: <1%

BBVA: -0.4% (contraction)

Mexico Business News: 0.1%
The downturn reflects global uncertainty, falling U.S. demand, and investment hesitancy.

Inflation & Monetary Policy:
Core inflation: 3.5–3.85% (above target). Banxico cut rates to 8.5% in May 2025, with more cuts expected to support growth.

Fiscal Challenges:

Deficit: 5.1% in 2024, targeting 3.5% in 2025

Public Debt: Projected at 53.1% of GDP

Pemex Liabilities: Government aid to Pemex strains public finances

Key Sectors:

Manufacturing: Particularly automotive; exposed to U.S. tariff risks

Tourism: Vital in states like Quintana Roo

Nearshoring: Rising interest, but tempered by USMCA review uncertainty

Infrastructure Projects: Tren Maya, Interoceanic Corridor aim to boost connectivity and growth

Public Administration
Executive Dominance:
The Sheinbaum administration continues centralization, weakening institutional pluralism.

Judicial Politicization:
Reforms compromise merit-based judicial appointments, raising technical and rights-based concerns.

Budget Constraints:
Rigid cash transfer programs and Pemex bailouts limit fiscal flexibility.

Capacity Gaps:
Chronic underinvestment in health, education, and R&D persist.

Criminal Justice / Law / Legal Studies / Studies in Law
Legal System:
Civil law-based with constitutional supremacy. Judicial system under pressure from politicized reforms.

Human Rights Situation (2025):

Violence: Over 300,000 murdered since 2015; cartels fuel mass killings and disappearances.

Disappearances: 120,740+ recorded since 1962.

Torture: Widely used during arrests; impunity is high.

Freedom of Press: One of the deadliest countries for journalists.

Femicide: Rising; 829 cases in 2024 vs 428 in 2015.

Arbitrary Detention: Practices like arraigo and pretrial detention persist.

Migrants & Refugees: App-based processes (e.g., CBP One) criticized; militarization of migration leads to abuses.

Land Defenders: Mexico ranks among the most dangerous for environmental defenders.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies
Predominant Faith:
Roman Catholicism remains culturally dominant, though pluralism is rising.

Freedom of Religion:

Gender Studies
Historic Presidency:
Claudia Sheinbaum’s election breaks political glass ceilings, but structural challenges persist.

Gender-Based Violence:
Femicide is endemic; women searching for missing relatives face harassment and death threats.

Abortion Rights:
Progressive in some states, criminalized in others. Legal disparity reflects federalist structure.

Intersectionality:
Indigenous and rural women face compounded barriers in healthcare, justice, and education.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous / Ethnic Studies
Cultural Diversity:
Mexico is home to 60+ Indigenous groups (e.g., Nahua, Zapotec, Maya, Mixtec). Afro-Mexican recognition is recent but uneven.

Social Stratification:
Inequality is closely tied to ethnicity, geography, and class. Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities suffer systemic exclusion.

Organized Crime & Social Disruption:
Cartels dominate entire regions, eroding community cohesion and replacing state presence.

Migration & Displacement:
Internal displacement due to violence is rising. Mexico also faces pressures as a transit and destination country for migrants.

Philosophy
Sovereignty & Nationalism:
A philosophical cornerstone, guiding resistance to U.S. influence and intervention.

Populism:
Morena’s ideology promotes a people-centric narrative, criticizing neoliberalism and institutional elites.

Justice vs. Impunity:
Ongoing tension between formal justice and persistent impunity fuels mistrust in law enforcement and courts.

Cultural Identity:
Philosophical debates persist over mestizaje, Indigenous identity, colonial legacy, and the U.S.-Mexico relationship.

History
Pre-Columbian Civilizations:
Olmecs, Mayans, and Aztecs flourished with advanced systems in science, architecture, and governance.

Social workers support survivors of disappearances, violence, and GBV — often at great personal risk.

Cash Transfers:
Programs like Bienestar and pensions are central to Mexico’s poverty alleviation strategy.

Migrants & Refugees:
Support services for Central American migrants and deportees include shelters, legal aid, and trauma counseling.

Public Health:
Efforts continue to expand access to health services, particularly in underserved rural and Indigenous areas.

Children’s Protection:
Child labor, trafficking, and school dropouts remain critical issues requiring social work intervention.

Journalism / Communication / Media Studies / Digital Media / Social Media Marketing / Public Relations

Mexico remains one of the deadliest countries for media workers. Impunity for violence against journalists remains the norm.

Censorship & Disinformation:
Troll armies, targeted attacks, and government messaging often drown out dissenting narratives.

Plays a vital role in exposing corruption, but faces funding challenges and violent reprisals.
