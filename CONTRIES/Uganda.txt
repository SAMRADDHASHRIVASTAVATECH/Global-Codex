Entrenched NRM Rule and Deteriorating Credibility of Elections (July 2025): Uganda continues to be dominated by the National Resistance Movement (NRM) and President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986. While regular elections are held, their credibility has significantly deteriorated due to alleged patronage, intimidation, and politicized prosecutions of opposition leaders. The NRM maintains power through various undemocratic means, including the use of public resources and patronage networks, and political interference in the military and judiciary.

Repression and Violence Against Opposition: The political landscape remains characterized by repression and violence against opposition figures and supporters. Politically motivated disappearances and reports of torture in detention have increased. Opposition leaders, such as Kizza Besigye, have faced arbitrary detentions and charges that many see as politically motivated. The government uses COVID-19 restrictions and other measures to violently disperse opposition rallies.

Parliamentary Dynamics: The unicameral Parliament has 556 seats, with 499 directly elected members (including 146 reserved for women) and 30 members representing special interest groups (youth, elderly, workers, military, persons with disabilities). The military holds 10 reserve seats. While a multiparty system was adopted in 2005, restrictive requirements and harassment hinder opposition parties' ability to compete effectively. The executive branch exerts significant influence over legislation through various means, including inducement and intimidation.

Regional and International Relations: Uganda continues to engage regionally, particularly within the East African Community (EAC). Internationally, relations are complex, with significant aid and investment (e.g., from the World Bank) balanced against strong international criticism over human rights issues, especially concerning LGBTQ+ rights.

Economic Outlook

Strong Growth Projections with Oil Production on Horizon (July 2025): Uganda's economy is showing robust growth, projected at 6.3% by end of June 2025 and 7% for the fiscal year 2025/26. This growth is driven by broad-based expansion in services and industrial sectors, supported by strong government investments in infrastructure (electricity, transport, ICT), improved access to credit, and increased Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).

The Minister of Finance, Matia Kasaija, projects the economy to reach $61.3 billion by June 2025.

A major driver for future growth is the anticipated start of commercial oil production, expected in 2026. This is projected to significantly boost growth, potentially reaching double digits by FY27, with positive spillover effects across other sectors.

Disinflation and Exchange Rate Stability: Inflation has remained tame, declining to 3.4% as of May 2025, well within the Central Bank's 5% target. The Ugandan Shilling has also shown stability, appreciating by 4% year-on-year against the USD in April 2025, attributed to strong export receipts, FDI, and tourism earnings.

Fiscal Position and Revenue: Net revenue collections from July 2024 to April 2025 reached Ushs 24.9 trillion, slightly below target but showing a 12.64% growth compared to the previous year. The total projected revenue for FY25 is Ushs 31.9 trillion (14.3% of GDP), with a projected budget deficit of 7.6% of GDP. The government aims to collect Ushs 37.2 trillion in domestic revenue in FY26.

Key Economic Sectors and Initiatives:

Agriculture: While still employing a large portion of the workforce, the government aims for full monetization of commercial agriculture through initiatives like the Parish Development Model (PDM).

Exports: Gold (USD 3.8 billion) and Coffee (USD 1.83 billion) are top export earners. Total goods and services exports reached USD 11.8 billion.

Tourism: Tourism earnings reached USD 1.52 billion, a 13.1% increase, reflecting sustained peace and infrastructure upgrades.

Wealth Creation Initiatives: The government continues to invest in programs like PDM, Youth Livelihood Fund, and Investment for Industrial Transformation and Employment (INVITE) to boost household incomes and create employment.

Poverty Reduction: Poverty is expected to decline slightly in FY25, with a faster reduction anticipated as economic growth accelerates, especially with strategic investment of oil revenues in social services, infrastructure, and human capital, potentially lowering poverty rates to 38% by 2027.

Public Administration

Government Priorities (FY 2025/26 Budget): The budget for FY 2025/26 is themed "Full Monetisation of Uganda's Economy through Commercial Agriculture, Industrialisation, Expanding and Broadening Services, Digital Transformation and Market Access." This aligns with the National Development Plan IV (NDPIV) 2025/26â€“2029/30, focusing on higher household incomes and employment.

Digital Transformation in Revenue Collection: President Museveni has emphasized digital tax reforms, including the Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing Solution (EFRIS) and deploying intrusive scanners, to boost revenue collection and combat smuggling.

Anti-Corruption Efforts: The President has also called for strengthening anti-corruption efforts within the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) and warned against political bribery and vote-buying.

Centralization of Power: Despite stated goals of improving public service delivery, the centralization of power within the executive, particularly around President Museveni and the NRM leadership, can hinder genuine accountability and transparency in public administration. Many government departments deny requests for information under the Access to Information Act.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA) and its Impact (July 2025): The Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA), enacted in May 2023, continues to have a devastating impact. In April 2025, the Constitutional Court upheld the majority of the AHA, including provisions that impose severe penalties (including death for "aggravated homosexuality" and up to 20 years for "promotion of homosexuality"). While some provisions were struck down (e.g., obligation for third parties to report, criminalizing renting to LGBT people, restricting healthcare access), the law has unleashed widespread discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ people, their families, and supporters.

Human Rights Watch reported in May 2025 on intensified abuse, including arbitrary arrests, detention, entrapment via social media, and extortion, alongside physical attacks and online harassment. Police are reported to take no discernible action on reports of attacks.

Prominent LGBTQ+ organizations have been targeted, with bans, staff arrests, and harassment of lawyers.

Suppression of Free Expression and Assembly: The government continues to clamp down on free expression, peaceful assembly, and dissent. Individuals are arrested and charged for criticizing officials online under laws against hate speech and "malicious information." Protests, including anti-corruption demonstrations, are met with mass arrests.

Environmental Defenders at Risk: Environmental rights defenders and anti-fossil fuel activists face threats and arbitrary arrests for raising concerns about projects like the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP).

Political Prosecutions and Military Courts: Opposition leaders and supporters continue to face politically motivated charges, including "terrorism." There are instances where civilians are tried in military courts, despite Constitutional Court rulings against this practice.

NGO Law Amendments: Amendments to the NGO law (NGO (Amendment) Act, 2024, signed in July 2024) threaten to impose excessive governmental control over NGOs, impacting civil society space.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Predominantly Christian with Significant Muslim Minority: Uganda is a religiously diverse country, with a majority Christian population (predominantly Catholic and Anglican) and a significant Muslim minority.

Role of Religious Leaders in Public Discourse: Religious leaders often play a prominent role in public discourse, sometimes aligning with or influencing government policies. President Museveni's government uses patronage networks to build political support among religious leaders.

Religious Freedom and Anti-Homosexuality Act: While freedom of worship is generally practiced, the strong religious condemnation of homosexuality, particularly by some Christian leaders, heavily influenced the passage and public support for the Anti-Homosexuality Act. This creates a challenging environment for religious freedom for LGBTQ+ individuals and those who support them.

Gender Studies

Women's Political Representation: While Parliament reserves 146 seats for women, their overall political influence and representation beyond these quotas face challenges due to the broader political environment. The "Generating opportunities and Productivity for Women (GROW)" initiative, with Ushs 824 billion allocated, indicates government focus on women's economic empowerment.

Impact of Anti-Homosexuality Act: The AHA has severe gendered implications, particularly for lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women who face heightened discrimination, violence, and threats to their safety and rights.

Maternal Mortality: While maternal mortality rates have improved, preventable deaths continue, highlighting ongoing challenges in women's health.

Violence Against Women and Girls: Violence against women and girls remains prevalent in Uganda. The EU-UN Spotlight initiative on the elimination of violence against women and girls continues to operate.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Diverse Ethnic Groups: Uganda is home to a rich diversity of ethnic groups, with over 50 indigenous languages and cultures. This diversity can lead to complex social dynamics and occasional tensions.

Poverty and Social Stratification: Despite economic growth, a significant portion of the population (42% in 2019/2020) lives below the poverty line, indicating substantial socio-economic stratification. Government initiatives like PDM aim to address this by bringing more households into the cash economy.

Impact of Anti-Homosexuality Act: The AHA has intensified social discrimination and stigma against LGBTQ+ individuals, leading to a hostile social climate and human rights abuses. This reflects a deep social conservative strain within the country.

Urban-Rural Divide: The shift from subsistence farming (90% in 1986 to 33% today) highlights ongoing rural-to-urban migration and a changing social landscape, though the agricultural sector still employs two-thirds of the workforce and faces low productivity.

Refugee Hosting: Uganda continues to host a large refugee population (over 1.7 million by end of 2024), mainly from DRC, Sudan, and South Sudan, which creates social and economic pressures on host communities and requires significant humanitarian support.

Philosophy

Authoritarianism vs. Democratic Ideals: Uganda's political reality presents a stark philosophical conflict between the principles of democratic governance, human rights, and the rule of law, and the entrenched authoritarian control of the NRM and President Museveni. The suppression of dissent and manipulation of electoral processes challenge fundamental notions of popular sovereignty and individual freedom.

Development vs. Rights: The government's emphasis on economic development and poverty reduction, while laudable, is often juxtaposed against a worsening human rights record, particularly concerning LGBTQ+ rights and freedom of expression. This raises philosophical questions about the trade-offs, if any, between economic progress and civil liberties.

Justice and Legal Interpretation: The Constitutional Court's upholding of the Anti-Homosexuality Act highlights a philosophical divergence in the interpretation of justice and human rights, particularly between domestic legal frameworks and international human rights norms.

History

Pre-Colonial Kingdoms: Uganda has a rich history of powerful pre-colonial kingdoms, such as Buganda, Bunyoro, Ankole, and Tooro.

British Protectorate: Became a British protectorate in the late 19th century.

Independence (1962): Gained independence in 1962.

Post-Independence Instability: Experienced significant political instability, including coups and periods of brutal authoritarian rule under Milton Obote and Idi Amin.

Museveni Era (since 1986): Yoweri Museveni came to power in 1986 following a five-year guerrilla war. His NRM government initially brought stability and some economic recovery. However, over recent decades, his rule has become increasingly authoritarian, extending his tenure through constitutional amendments.

Anti-Homosexuality Act: The passage of the Anti-Homosexuality Act in 2023 marked a significant regression in human rights and garnered widespread international condemnation, further shaping Uganda's recent history and international standing.

Oil Development: The ongoing development of Uganda's oil and gas sector represents a pivotal historical moment, poised to reshape its economic future from 2026 onwards.

Social Work

Support for Vulnerable Populations: Social workers are crucial in addressing the needs of vulnerable populations, including those in poverty (42% of Ugandans), the forcibly displaced (refugees and IDPs), and those impacted by the severe human rights abuses.

Responding to LGBTQ+ Discrimination: Given the legal framework and societal attitudes, social workers face immense challenges in supporting LGBTQ+ individuals who experience discrimination, violence, arbitrary arrest, and denial of services. Providing safe spaces, legal aid referrals, and mental health support is critical but risky work.

Poverty Alleviation and Development Programs: Social workers are involved in implementing government wealth creation initiatives like PDM, working with communities to improve livelihoods, access credit, and integrate into the cash economy.

Trauma-Informed Care: Addressing the trauma experienced by victims of political repression, violence, and displacement is a significant area of focus for social workers in Uganda.

Child Protection: Social workers continue to address issues like the disappearance of children from slums and the prevalence of violence against children.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Restricted Media Environment: Media freedom in Uganda is severely restricted. Journalists critical of the government face intimidation, harassment, arrest, detention, and even assault.

Censorship and Self-Censorship: Government authorities raid and shut down independent media outlets and remove accreditation from journalists. This leads to widespread self-censorship.

Online Suppression: Freedom of expression online is curtailed, with individuals being charged for criticizing officials on social media platforms. Social media restrictions are common during protests.

Government Propaganda: State-aligned media outlets dominate the narrative, often promoting government successes and suppressing dissenting information.

Challenges for Independent Reporting: Despite these challenges, independent journalists and media organizations continue to operate, often at great personal risk, attempting to provide alternative perspectives and hold power accountable.

Education / Teaching

Government Investment: The government continues to invest in education, with the budget for FY 2025/26 allocating funds to education as a key priority.

Skilling Youth: Initiatives like free training at Zonal Industrial Hubs aim to skill youth, aligning education with the needs of industrialization and job creation, particularly with the upcoming oil sector.

Access to Education: While there are efforts to improve access, challenges such as disparities in quality between urban and rural areas, and the impact of poverty on school attendance, likely persist.

Academic Freedom: Similar to media freedom, academic freedom may be curtailed, particularly concerning critical analysis of government policies or politically sensitive topics.

Impact of Global Financial Sanctions: The World Bank's resumption of funding, previously suspended due to the Anti-Homosexuality Act, is significant for the education sector, as such international aid is crucial for development programs.

Library Science

Preserving National Heritage: Libraries in Uganda play a role in preserving the country's diverse cultural heritage, history, and literary works, reflecting its various ethnic groups and historical periods.

Information Access and Literacy: Libraries contribute to promoting literacy and providing access to information, which is particularly important in a developing country with a large population.

Challenges of Censorship and Resources: The general restrictions on freedom of information and expression, alongside potential resource limitations, may impact the range and accessibility of materials available in libraries.

Supporting Research: Academic libraries support research in various fields, contributing to knowledge creation and dissemination, though the scope of research may be influenced by prevailing political and social sensitivities.
