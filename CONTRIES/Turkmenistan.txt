Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Totalitarian Rule and Dynastic Succession (July 2025): Turkmenistan continues to operate as a highly authoritarian, totalitarian state. While nominally a presidential republic, real power is concentrated in the hands of the "National Leader of the Turkmen People," Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, who was appointed to this role in January 2023. His son, Serdar Berdimuhamedow, is the current President, a position largely stripped of real authority. No genuine opposition parties are permitted, and all registered political parties support the current President. This effectively makes Turkmenistan an "absolute monarchy" in the view of many outside observers.

Permanent Neutrality as Foreign Policy Cornerstone: Turkmenistan's foreign policy is based on its declared status of "permanent neutrality," recognized by the United Nations in 1995. This policy aims to avoid alignment with major powers while actively engaging in international and regional initiatives. The year 2025 has been declared the "International Year of Peace and Trust" at Turkmenistan's initiative, reflecting its continued emphasis on peace and cooperation in global relations.

Regional Role: Turkmenistan plays a significant geopolitical role due to its vast natural gas resources and its strategic location, sharing borders with Afghanistan and Iran. It positions itself as a transportation, humanitarian, and economic link to Afghanistan and South Asia, contributing to regional stability. Efforts are underway to strengthen economic ties with neighboring states, for example, through the Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan Free Trade Regime which came into effect in early 2025.

International Engagement: Turkmenistan maintains diplomatic activities with various countries and international organizations. The 17th Human Rights Dialogue between Turkmenistan and the European Union was held in Brussels in June 2025, and there was a session of the Interdepartmental Commission on Ensuring the Implementation of Turkmenistan's International Obligations in the Field of Human Rights in February 2025. This indicates a degree of formal engagement with international human rights mechanisms, though the actual implementation of obligations remains highly problematic.

Economic Outlook

Hydrocarbon-Dependent Growth (July 2025): Turkmenistan's economy remains heavily reliant on its vast natural gas and oil resources. Economic growth is projected to be moderate in 2025, with forecasts ranging from 1.8% (EBRD) to 6.5% (ADB). The official State News Agency of Turkmenistan reported 6.3% GDP growth for January-May 2025, with high growth rates in transport, communications, trade, and services.

Challenges of Diversification and Transparency: The IMF's 2025 Article IV Mission noted that the main economic challenge is to translate hydrocarbon wealth into more diversified, sustainable, and inclusive growth. They recommend a more market-based strategy, reforms to monetary and exchange rate frameworks, increased public spending efficiency, and enhanced governance and transparency. The country's massive revenues from natural gas sales are widely believed not to trickle down to the average Turkmen, and corruption is reportedly rife.

Inflation and Fiscal Position: Inflation decelerated to 1.1% in March 2025 (IMF), primarily due to slower food inflation. The state budget balance is projected to remain in a small surplus in 2025, supported by strong revenue from energy and non-energy products.

Foreign Investment Climate: While the country's natural gas and oil resources attract foreign companies, the government has yet to implement reforms needed to create an inviting business climate, such as allowing onshore natural gas production-sharing agreements. Weaknesses like nepotism and restrictive customs/tax regimes disincentivize some foreign direct investment, especially for SMEs.

Digitalization and Infrastructure: Investments in communications are planned for 2025, aiming to increase telephone lines and mobile subscribers, and improve internet access in remote areas, as part of a national program for socio-economic development and digitalization of regions.

Public Administration

Centralized Control: Public administration in Turkmenistan is characterized by a high degree of centralization and control by the executive, particularly the "National Leader." The judiciary is wholly subservient to the regime, with judges appointed for five-year terms by the President without legislative review.

Lack of Transparency: Transparency and accountability in public administration are severely lacking. There have been few efforts to prosecute corrupt officials.

Social Protection System Assessment (June 2025): In a joint effort to enhance its social protection system, the Government of Turkmenistan, in partnership with UNICEF, the ILO, and the World Bank, launched a Core Diagnostic Instrument (CODI) assessment in May 2025. This initiative aims to identify strengths, address gaps, and guide evidence-based improvements to ensure more effective, equitable, and inclusive social protection services, with a focus on vulnerable populations.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Lack of Judicial Independence: The judiciary in Turkmenistan lacks independence and is subservient to the regime. Judges are appointed by the President.

Human Rights Violations and Arbitrary Detentions: The human rights situation is dire. Authorities continue to impose arbitrary foreign travel bans and engage in transnational repression. There are widespread reports of groundless bars on international travel, difficulties in obtaining passports, and forced returns for Turkmen citizens living abroad.

Persecution of Critics: The government allows no space for dissent and prohibits activity by unregistered NGOs. Activists, journalists, and bloggers face persecution, imprisonment, torture, and even death. Individuals are summoned, have their devices confiscated, and are held in detention for allegedly working with independent outlets.

Torture and Ill-treatment: Concerns about torture and ill-treatment are prominent. The UN Committee against Torture (CAT) reviewed Turkmenistan's compliance in April 2025 and noted concerns, particularly regarding the failure to provide a secure and confidential complaint mechanism for those deprived of liberty.

Arbitrary Laws and Lack of Due Process: Individuals engaging in unauthorized religious activities are severely punished. Authorities are believed to have requested Turkish authorities to deport exiled Turkmen activists.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

State Control over Religion: The Turkmen authorities tightly monitor registered religious groups and forbid unregistered congregations. Individuals engaging in religious activities outside state-approved religions face severe punishment and lengthy prison sentences.

Islam as Dominant Religion: The majority of the population is Sunni Muslim. However, even the practice of Islam is subject to state control. In April 2025, security services reportedly warned state sector employees who had taken part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage not to display their faith at work, grow beards, or wear white headscarves, forcing those who refused to sign "voluntary" resignation letters.

Limited Religious Freedom: The government's actions demonstrate a severe restriction on religious freedom, limiting it to state-sanctioned activities and interfering even with personal expressions of faith.

Gender Studies

Restrictions on Women's Autonomy: Despite proclaimed commitment to women's rights, authorities have actively reinforced discriminatory gender stereotypes and practices. A campaign launched after President Serdar Berdimuhamedow assumed office in March 2022 continues to restrict and control women's appearance and behavior, purportedly in the name of preserving national traditions.

Bodily Autonomy and Health: Abortions after five weeks of pregnancy remain outlawed. There are widespread reports of serious restrictions on women's and girls' autonomy, including arbitrary requirements like a minimum age of 35 to obtain driver's licenses, and mandatory gynecological examinations for secondary school girls in some regions to verify their "moral purity."

Formal Engagement with International Commitments: Turkmenistan's Human Rights Dialogue with the EU in June 2025 included discussions on ensuring gender equality and fulfilling obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the National Action Plan on Gender Equality for 2021-2025. However, these formal engagements stand in stark contrast to the reported on-the-ground realities.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

State-Controlled Culture and Identity: The government exerts total control over cultural expression, promoting a highly controlled and nationalistic narrative. Events like mandatory attendance at presidential book presentations and forced purchases of the President's works (as reported in January 2025) are examples of this.

Impact of Isolation: Turkmenistan's closed society and limited access to information shape social interactions and cultural development.

Economic Disparity and Social Issues: The failure of hydrocarbon wealth to trickle down to the average citizen contributes to economic marginalization. Authorities respond to complaints about food shortages and price increases with fines and interrogations, indicating a lack of freedom to express grievances.

Philosophy

Totalitarian Control vs. Individual Liberty: The philosophical foundation of Turkmenistan's governance is one of absolute state control, where individual liberties and freedoms are suppressed in favor of the regime's directives and a tightly controlled national narrative. This stands in stark opposition to principles of liberal democracy and human rights.

"Permanent Neutrality" as a Guiding Principle: The philosophy of "permanent neutrality" is deeply ingrained in Turkmenistan's state policy, aiming to position the country as a non-aligned, peace-promoting actor on the global stage. However, this external image often contrasts with the internal realities of political repression.

National Identity and Tradition: The government's emphasis on "preserving national traditions and values," particularly in relation to women's behavior, reflects a top-down philosophical approach to national identity that prioritizes state-defined norms over individual autonomy.

History

Soviet Republic: Turkmenistan was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union from 1925 until its dissolution.

Independence (1991) and Niyazov's Rule: Gained independence in 1991. Saparmurat Niyazov, the former head of the Turkmen Communist Party, became the first President, ruling with totalitarian control as "Turkmenbashi" (Leader of all Turkmens) until his death in 2006. His rule was marked by an extreme cult of personality and eccentric policies.

Berdimuhamedow Senior (2007-2022): Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow succeeded Niyazov in 2007. While he repealed some of Niyazov's most idiosyncratic policies and introduced some limited reforms (e.g., in education), he maintained an authoritarian system, developing his own personality cult.

Dynastic Succession and "National Leader" (2022-Present): In 2022, his son Serdar Berdimuhamedow was elected President, a move widely seen as a dynastic succession. In January 2023, the elder Berdimuhamedow was appointed "National Leader of the Turkmen People" and Chairman of the People's Council, effectively retaining supreme political authority. The current period in July 2025 sees the continuation of this highly centralized and authoritarian political structure.

Social Work

Limited Space for Independent Social Work: Due to the severe restrictions on unregistered non-governmental organizations and the overall closed civic space, independent social work and advocacy are extremely limited and dangerous in Turkmenistan.

Addressing Economic Marginalization: Social workers, likely operating within state-controlled frameworks, would address issues related to economic marginalization, food shortages, and access to basic services, though complaints are often met with punitive measures.

Social Protection System Development: The joint assessment launched in May 2025 with UNICEF, ILO, and the World Bank on strengthening the social protection system indicates a formal effort to improve welfare services. Social workers would be involved in the implementation of these state-led programs, aiming to reach vulnerable populations.

Human Rights Advocacy (Restricted): The ability of social workers to advocate for human rights or challenge systemic abuses is severely curtailed by the authoritarian regime.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

No Media Freedom: Turkmenistan has virtually no media freedom. It consistently ranks at the very bottom of global press freedom indices (174th out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index 2025).

State Control and Censorship: All media outlets are effectively controlled by the government and are required to promote a positive image of the regime. Criticism of officials is banned.

Internet Censorship and Limited Access: Internet access is severely limited and heavily censored, with thousands of domains, including social media networks, messenger apps, and news sites, arbitrarily blocked. Internet speed remains extremely low.

Persecution of Journalists: Independent journalists and bloggers face persecution, imprisonment, torture, or even death. This forces self-censorship and makes it nearly impossible to access unbiased information.

Propaganda: The government actively uses state media and events, like mandatory book presentations by the President, to disseminate propaganda.

Education / Teaching

State Control over Curriculum: The education system is under strict state control, with curriculum heavily influenced by the government's ideology and national narrative.

Limited Academic Freedom: Academic freedom is severely restricted. Emphasis is placed on technical skills and patriotic education, rather than critical thinking or open inquiry.

Language Policy: Turkmen is the primary language of instruction, with some Russian. English is taught but access to international educational resources may be limited.

Restoration of Educational Standards: Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow (the "National Leader") had previously increased basic education from 9 to 10 years and restored higher education from two years to five, aiming to somewhat reverse some of Niyazov's more extreme policies that damaged the education system.

Library Science

Preserving National Narratives: Libraries in Turkmenistan are likely to focus on preserving and promoting the officially sanctioned national narrative, history, and literature, often including the works of the "National Leader" and current President.

Limited Access to Diverse Information: Due to strict censorship and internet restrictions, the ability of libraries to provide access to a wide range of international information, diverse perspectives, or critical analyses is severely limited.

Role in Literacy and State-Approved Learning: Libraries would serve to promote literacy and support learning based on the state-approved curriculum and educational materials.

Digitalization within Constraints: While there may be efforts towards digitalization within libraries, these would operate under the same constraints of censorship and limited internet access that affect the broader information landscape.
