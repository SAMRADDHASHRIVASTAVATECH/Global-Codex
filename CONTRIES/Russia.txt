Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Authoritarian Presidential Republic: In July 2025, Russia remains an authoritarian presidential republic with power highly concentrated in the hands of President Vladimir Putin. He was re-elected in March 2024 with a heavily manipulated election, where genuine opposition candidates were barred from participating. Constitutional amendments in 2020 allow Putin to potentially stay in power until 2036. The executive branch, including the Prime Minister (Mikhail Mishustin, as of July 2025), operates under the President's direct control. The legislature (Federal Assembly, comprising the State Duma and Federation Council) is largely subservient, and genuine political competition is not tolerated.

Strategic Leadership and Confrontation with the West: Russia's strategic leadership, under Putin, is characterized by an emphasis on national interests, a confrontational stance towards the West, and a focus on strengthening its global standing. This involves an assertive deterrence strategy, including the updated nuclear doctrine (2020 and 2024), and reliance on strategic partnerships with countries like China and Iran to address supply needs and offset Western pressure. The Kremlin's ideological framework frames the ongoing conflict in Ukraine as part of a broader confrontation with NATO and US dominance.

Foreign Policy:

Ukraine War: The full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues to dominate Russia's foreign policy. Russia views the conflict as a defense of its interests against what it perceives as NATO expansion and seeks to achieve its objectives through military means and political pressure.

Anti-Western Stance: Russia maintains a staunchly anti-Western, hawkish rhetoric, emphasizing perceived threats from NATO expansion and alleged plots to undermine Russia.

Multipolar World Order: Russia advocates for a multi-polar world order, challenging the unipolar dominance of the United States and seeking to build alliances with countries that share a similar vision.

Strategic Partnerships: Strengthening ties with countries like China, India, and Iran remains a priority to circumvent Western sanctions and establish alternative economic and political blocs. Foreign Office Consultations with India took place in March 2025, reviewing bilateral ties and global issues.

Energy Security: Russia continues to position itself as a key player in global energy markets, despite Western efforts to reduce reliance on its oil and gas.

Information Warfare: Russia actively employs information isolation and propaganda to sustain political unity domestically and influence international narratives.

Economic Outlook

War Economy and Resilience Amid Sanctions: Russia's economy in 2025 is operating on a "war footing," showing a degree of resilience to international sanctions, largely driven by high military expenditure, rising household consumption and wages, and increased government spending. GDP growth is projected around 1.5% for 2025 (IMF), lower than the growth seen in 2023-2024.

Signs of Overheating and Recession Warnings: Despite official optimism, there are growing warnings from within the Russian government, including the Economy Minister, that the economy is "overheated" and on the "brink of transitioning into recession." Inflation remains comparatively high (projected around 5.9% in 2025), and rising prices are causing concern among the populace.

Fiscal Strain: The government is ramping up borrowing as oil revenues falter and war spending soars. The National Wealth Fund's liquid assets have significantly plummeted, indicating depletion of financial reserves used to prop up the economy.

Impact of Sanctions: While Russia has adapted, sanctions continue to have a long-term negative effect. Foreign investment has fallen to its lowest level since 2001. The ruble has weakened against major currencies, and industrial factories face labor shortages, partly due to military conscription. Western companies continue to exit, and international efforts to crack down on sanctions circumvention are increasing, with the EU proposing a gradual phase-out of Russian gas and oil imports by the end of 2027.

Social Spending: Despite military spending, the government is committed to improving citizen well-being, focusing on poverty reduction, social protection, and family support, with significant allocations for benefits and pension increases (insurance pensions increased by 7.3% as of January 2025, then further to 9.5% in line with inflation).

Public Administration

Centralized Control: The Kremlin maintains tight control over all levels of government, with decision-making highly centralized around the President and his inner circle.

Social Treasury Mechanisms: The government is streamlining processes for allotting and providing social privileges and benefits, converting over 60 state support measures to proactive assistance principles.

Focus on National Projects: New national projects, particularly on technological leadership (including space activities and bioeconomy), are being launched in 2025, consolidating efforts across government, business, and research to achieve national goals.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Authoritarian Legal Framework: Russia's legal system is used to suppress dissent and maintain state control. Laws on "foreign agents," "undesirable organizations," "extremism," and "war censorship" are extensively used to target critics, media, and human rights defenders.

Judicial Subservience: The courts are subservient to the Kremlin, and fair trials are often not guaranteed, particularly in politically motivated cases.

Human Rights (2025):

Freedom of Expression: Severely curtailed. Laws criminalize "fake news" about the military and "discrediting" the armed forces. Advertising in "foreign agent" media is prohibited.

Political Prisoners: The number of political prisoners continues to grow, with over 800 reported by Memorial. Many are imprisoned for speaking out against the war in Ukraine. Prominent opposition figures have died in prison or been imprisoned.

LGBTQ+ Rights: The crackdown on LGBTQ+ people continues, with the Supreme Court's November 2023 ruling outlawing the "international LGBT movement" as "extremist," leading to arbitrary prosecutions. "Gay propaganda" laws are actively enforced.

Women's Reproductive Rights: Attacks on women's reproductive rights continue, with regional authorities pressuring private clinics to stop performing abortions, and some regions outlawing "persuading" women to have abortions. Laws banning "propaganda" for "refusing to have children" have been introduced.

Torture and Ill-Treatment: Reports from the UN Special Rapporteur indicate widespread and systematic use of torture and ill-treatment in detention facilities.

Censorship and Isolation: The Kremlin is poised to launch a new "national messenger" application, affiliated with VKontakte, to further censor citizens and isolate them from the global internet.

War Crimes: The UN OHCHR has reported credible allegations of executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russian forces and systematic torture in Russian captivity. Indiscriminate bombings and shelling of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine continue.

Death Penalty: Abolished.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Russian Orthodox Church: The Russian Orthodox Church is the dominant religious institution and is closely aligned with the state, supporting the government's policies and receiving significant financial support and privileged status.

Religious Freedom (Restricted): While freedom of worship is constitutionally recognized, certain religious groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, are banned as "extremist" and their members face imprisonment.

Gender Studies

Underrepresentation in Politics: Women are significantly underrepresented in politics and government, holding less than 17% of Duma seats and 18% of Federation Council seats as of 2024.

Limited Rights: Issues of importance to women are not prominent in Russian politics. Attacks on reproductive rights and lack of comprehensive LGBTQ+ protections indicate a regressive trend in gender equality.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

National Identity: Russian national identity is heavily promoted by the state, emphasizing a strong, unified nation, often in opposition to perceived Western influence.

Suppression of Indigenous Rights: The government has outlawed some indigenous rights groups as "extremist" under broad legislation.

Societal Control: Security agencies maintain tight control over society, suppressing any political challenges. Employers often pressure employees to vote, especially in the public sector.

Philosophy

Eurasianism and Traditional Values: Russian official philosophy often promotes Eurasianism, emphasizing Russia's unique civilizational path distinct from the West, and "traditional values" which are used to justify conservative social policies and suppress LGBTQ+ rights.

State Primacy: A strong emphasis on the primacy of the state over individual rights is a core philosophical tenet of the current regime.

Nuclear Deterrence: The evolving nuclear doctrine reflects a philosophical view of nuclear weapons as a tool for assertive deterrence and maintaining global standing.

History

Imperial Past: Russia has a long imperial history, marked by expansion and periods of powerful centralized rule.

Soviet Era (1917-1991): Seventy years of Soviet communist rule, characterized by a command economy, political repression, and a powerful global role.

Post-Soviet Transition (1991-present): Transition to a market economy and a new political system after the collapse of the USSR, followed by increasing authoritarianism under Vladimir Putin.

Ukraine War: The ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine, starting in February 2022, is a defining event in contemporary Russian history, with profound domestic and international consequences.

Social Work

State-Controlled Social Welfare: Russia has a state-provided social welfare system, including pensions, social benefits, and healthcare.

Challenges: Social work faces challenges related to poverty (despite government efforts to reduce it), an aging population, and the social impact of the war, including support for veterans and families of those killed or wounded. The government is focused on streamlining access to social assistance.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Controlled Media Environment: The media environment is tightly controlled by the Kremlin. Independent media outlets have been suppressed, designated as "foreign agents," or shut down.

Censorship and Disinformation: Extensive censorship laws are in place, particularly regarding the war in Ukraine. Disinformation is rampant, both domestically and internationally.

Digital Control: The government is increasing its control over the internet and digital platforms, including plans for a new "national messenger" application to further censor citizens and isolate them from the global internet.

Education / Teaching

State-Controlled Curriculum: The education system is state-controlled, with increasing emphasis on patriotic education and a curriculum that aligns with official narratives, particularly regarding history and the conflict in Ukraine. In occupied areas of Ukraine, Russian curriculum is imposed, and Ukrainian language suppressed.

Brain Drain: The political climate and economic impact of sanctions have contributed to a brain drain, with many academics and skilled professionals leaving the country.

Library Science

Censorship: Libraries in Russia face increasing censorship, with restrictions on materials deemed "extremist" or those that contradict official narratives.

Propaganda: Libraries are likely utilized to disseminate state-approved information and propaganda.

Preservation: Efforts continue for the preservation of historical and cultural heritage, but within the confines of state ideology.
