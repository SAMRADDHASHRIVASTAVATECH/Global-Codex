Presidential Republic and Upcoming Elections (2025): Seychelles operates as a presidential republic. President Wavel Ramkalawan of the Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS) party, who came to power in October 2020, is expected to contest for his second term in the upcoming 2025 elections. This election will be a significant event, testing the continued democratic resilience of the nation after a long period of dominance by the United Seychelles party (and its predecessor) since a 1977 coup.

Focus on Governance and Transparency: A key area of focus for the current administration, and a likely theme for the 2025 elections, is the reduction of cronyism and an elevation of transparency standards. Seychelles has made strides in combating corruption, being removed from the EU's list of foreign tax havens in 2021 and ranking highly on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. The Anti-Corruption Commission of Seychelles (ACCS), strengthened by amendments in 2019, plays a vital role.

Strategic Leadership: Sustainable Development and "Blue Economy": Seychelles' strategic leadership is centered on sustainable development, particularly the "blue economy" concept, which aims to leverage marine resources for economic growth and improved livelihoods while preserving the ocean's ecosystem. The National Development Strategy (NDS) 2024-2028, launched in April 2024, prioritizes six key areas, including a transformative economic agenda and environmental sustainability/climate change resilience. The country is actively preparing for its 2025 Voluntary National Review (VNR) of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a focus on leaving no one behind.

Foreign Policy:

Climate Change Advocacy: As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) highly vulnerable to climate change, Seychelles is a leading voice on international platforms, advocating for climate action, adaptation, and resilience. Its blue bonds demonstrate innovative approaches to financing sustainable marine use.

Regional Security: Seychelles plays a vital role in maintaining open sea-lanes and combating piracy, illicit trafficking, and unsanctioned fisheries in its 1-million-km2 exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Its Coast Guard is well-trained, and the country has held numerous trials for suspected pirates. This position places it in the nexus of competing geostrategic interests between major powers like China and India.

Multilateralism and Partnerships: The Foreign Affairs Department's Strategic Plan 2021-2025 emphasizes "Harnessing Opportunities through Diplomatic Relations," aiming to strengthen bilateral, multilateral, and regional ties for mutual benefit. Seychelles actively participates in the UN, Council of Europe, and UNICEF. India, for example, conducted a joint surveillance of Seychelles' EEZ with the Seychelles Coast Guard in June-July 2025.

Economic Outlook

Tourism and Fisheries Driven Growth: The Seychellois economy is highly dependent on tourism (roughly 45% of GDP) and fisheries. Economic growth for 2025 is projected by the IMF at 3.2% and by the World Bank at 3.1%, although this is a downward revision from previous forecasts due to slower projected growth in Europe, Seychelles' primary tourism source market. The Ministry of Finance projects 4.3% growth for 2025.

Diversification Efforts: The government is actively pursuing economic diversification to reduce vulnerability to external shocks. Key initiatives include:

SME Support: Significant allocation (SCR 50 million in 2025 budget) to develop SME infrastructure.

Infrastructure Development: Projects like the Victoria Waterfront Redevelopment and land reclamation aim to expand commercial and industrial space.

Agriculture and Fisheries Investment: The 2025 agriculture budget allocates SCR 142 million for production and sustainability, including loans for agro-tourism and agro-forestry. New fisheries facilities are also planned.

Financial Services: Seychelles has established itself as an offshore financial center, contributing to the economy through banking, insurance, and investment management services.

Information and Telecommunications: This sector has shown strong growth and is projected for continued expansion in 2025.

Fiscal Health: Prudent macroeconomic policies and fiscal consolidation efforts have resulted in a stable public debt-to-GDP ratio (projected around 57.7% for 2025, with a target of reducing it to 50% before 2030). The country's current account deficit, however, remains widened due to reliance on imports.

Inflation: Year-on-year inflation is expected to moderate to 1.2% by end-2025 due to lower utility, fuel, and food prices.

Highest GDP per capita in Africa: Seychelles continues to boast the highest GDP per capita in Africa, exceeding $17,000, underscoring its economic success but also highlighting the challenge of ensuring benefits reach all citizens.

Public Administration

Modern Public Service: The National Development Strategy (NDS) 2024-2028 prioritizes "A Modern Public Service" and improvements in public financial management, financial sector supervision, and governance.

Digitalization and Transparency: The government is committed to digitalization efforts to enhance efficiency and transparency within public administration. These reforms are often supported by international partners like the IMF.

Religious Freedom: The constitution guarantees religious freedom, and it is generally respected in practice. The country prohibits political parties and religious organizations from operating public radio broadcasts to mitigate polarization.

Active Participation in Government: Women in Seychelles actively participate in government, holding cabinet positions and a proportion of seats in the National Assembly.

Economic Empowerment Focus: The National Development Strategy 2024-2028 emphasizes enhancing human capital through education and skills development, and creating more employment opportunities for women. Efforts are focused on improving the business environment for women entrepreneurs and supporting women in various sectors.

Philosophy

Sustainable Coexistence: The "blue economy" concept embodies a philosophy of sustainable coexistence with nature, recognizing the intrinsic link between environmental health and economic prosperity.

Resilience and Adaptability: Given its vulnerability to external shocks (climate change, global economic fluctuations), the guiding philosophy is one of building resilience and adaptability through prudent macroeconomic policies and diversification efforts.

Good Governance: The ongoing efforts to combat corruption and promote transparency reflect a philosophical commitment to ethical and accountable governance.

History

Uninhabited to Colonial Hub: Initially uninhabited, Seychelles became a strategic point for European powers, particularly France and Britain, due to its location. It was settled by French colonists and their enslaved African laborers in the mid-18th century.

British Colony: Became a British colony in the early 19th century.

Independence (1976): Gained independence from Britain in 1976.

One-Party Rule and Return to Multi-Partyism: After a coup in 1977, Seychelles transitioned to a one-party socialist state under France-Albert Ren√©, before returning to multiparty politics and a new constitution in the early 1990s. The 2020 election marked a significant democratic transition, bringing an opposition candidate to the presidency for the first time since multiparty elections were introduced.
