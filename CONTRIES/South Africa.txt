ANC/DA Government of National Unity (GNU): As of July 2025, South Africa is governed by a Government of National Unity (GNU), a landmark shift following the 2024 general election where the African National Congress (ANC) lost its outright majority, securing around 40% of the vote. The GNU is primarily a coalition between the ANC and its long-time rival, the Democratic Alliance (DA), marking a significant move towards a more centrist governing position. While this has been met with increased market confidence and public optimism, internal friction within the ANC and ideological differences with the DA pose challenges to the GNU's stability and longevity. The GNU's ability to deliver tangible improvements will be crucial before the 2026 municipal elections.

Shifting Political Landscape: The ANC's electoral decline is part of a broader trend in Southern Africa, where liberation movements face increasing challenges. Other significant political forces include the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), though MK's initial momentum has reportedly slowed.

Strategic Leadership and Reforms: The GNU has prioritised critical economic reforms, particularly in the logistics sector (ports and rail), acknowledging the private sector's crucial role in infrastructure development due to limited state resources. The government also aims to significantly reduce road fatalities by 2029 and enhance regional and global air travel connectivity.

Foreign Policy: South Africa continues its active role on the African continent and in multilateral forums. Its foreign policy often balances historical ties with the Global South and relationships with Western powers. The GNU's formation is expected to positively influence foreign direct investment due to perceived greater political predictability. South Africa also continues to engage vocally on international issues, as seen in its stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Economic Outlook

Modest Growth and Fiscal Challenges: South Africa's economy is expected to experience modest growth in 2025, with projections ranging from 0.8% to 1.7%. Growth is driven by private consumption and improvements in specific sectors, but structural issues persist. The country faces significant fiscal constraints, with a rising debt-to-GDP ratio approaching 80%.

Fiscal Consolidation and Tax Pressures: The 2025 budget process highlighted limited space for new revenue. A proposed VAT increase was abandoned due to widespread criticism, leading the Treasury to focus on alternative measures like bracket creep, fuel-levy adjustments, and intensified tax collection efforts to address a significant revenue shortfall. Fiscal credibility remains under pressure.

High Unemployment: Unemployment remains a critical challenge, with the official rate rising to 32.9% in Q1 2025 and youth unemployment at 46.1%. This is significantly higher than the rate needed to absorb new labour market entrants.

Sectoral Performance: While mining and manufacturing (petroleum & chemical products, food & beverages, motor vehicles) showed declines in Q1 2025, positive growth was observed in retail trade, motor trade (new vehicle sales), tourist accommodation, restaurants, and freight transport. Passenger rail services are also seeing a significant revival.

Inflation and Interest Rates: Consumer price inflation is forecast to average around 4.5% in 2025. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) is expected to continue reducing interest rates, aiming to keep inflation within its 3-6% target range, though above-inflation salary increases could pose a risk.

Infrastructure Investment: Private sector investment in crucial infrastructure, particularly in rail and port corridors, is deemed critical to address logistical bottlenecks and stimulate economic activity.

Public Administration

Reform and Service Delivery Focus: The GNU's agenda is heavily focused on improving service delivery and implementing reforms, particularly within state-owned enterprises (SOEs) like Transnet and PRASA, to enhance their operational effectiveness and competitiveness.

Anti-Corruption Efforts: Combating fraud and corruption remains a high priority. The Investigating Directorate Against Corruption (IDAC) is now a permanent entity within the National Prosecuting Authority, supported by a digital forensics lab. Over R10 billion has been recovered in state capture-related cases. Efforts are also underway to strengthen anti-money laundering and terror financing systems to exit the FATF grey list.

Digitalization: The government is leveraging technology, including surveillance, analytics, and AI in fraud risk detection within the South African Revenue Service.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Common Law System: South Africa's legal system is based on common law.

Declining Violent Crime (but still high): Recent crime statistics (January-March 2025) indicate a notable decrease in serious violent crimes, including murder (-12.4%) and aggravated robbery (-10.4%). However, rape cases saw a slight increase, and kidnappings continued to rise (+6.8%), highlighting ongoing challenges. Overall crime levels remain very high.

Policing Priorities: The South African Police Service (SAPS) is expanding its detective services, embracing technology, and strengthening community collaborations. Key priorities for the 7th Administration include reducing murder rates, combating illegal firearms, addressing Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF), and dismantling organised crime.

Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF): South Africa continues to grapple with alarmingly high rates of GBVF, including one of the highest rape rates globally and a femicide rate five times the global average. While the National Council on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide Act, 2024, has been enacted, its full operationalisation is still pending.

Whistleblower Protection: The government plans to finalise a new Whistleblower Protection Framework and introduce a Whistleblower Protections Bill in Parliament during this financial year.

Rule of Law: Efforts to combat corruption and strengthen the justice system are critical for upholding the rule of law. However, concerns persist regarding human rights in the justice system, exemplified by incidents of unlawful arrests and deportations of asylum seekers.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Diverse Religious Landscape: South Africa is religiously diverse, with a Christian majority and significant Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, and traditional African religious communities.

Role of Faith-Based Organizations: Faith-based organisations play a crucial role in social welfare, community development, and advocating for human rights and social justice.

Interfaith Dialogue: Interfaith dialogue is generally encouraged to promote social cohesion in a pluralistic society.

Gender Studies

GBVF Crisis: The pervasive issue of Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) remains a national crisis, with alarmingly high rates of violence against women and girls.

Policy and Implementation Gap: Despite progressive laws and the establishment of the National Council on GBVF, challenges persist in effective implementation and addressing underlying societal norms and power imbalances that perpetuate violence.

Advocacy: Civil society organisations continue to be vital in advocating for women's rights and holding the government accountable for addressing GBVF.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Post-Apartheid Challenges: South Africa's identity continues to be shaped by its complex history of apartheid and ongoing efforts to build a more equitable and inclusive society.

High Inequality: Significant income, wealth, and social inequality persist, contributing to social tensions.

Xenophobia: While incidents of xenophobic violence have reportedly decreased in 2024, anti-immigrant rhetoric remains a concern, and issues like unlawful arrests of asylum seekers highlight challenges for migrant rights.

Child Vulnerability: The high number of children killed (estimated 1,100 between April 2024 and March 2025) and exposure to violence in childhood are major societal concerns.

Post-Election Optimism: Surveys indicate a surge in public optimism following the formation of the GNU, with increased faith in democratic processes and hope for improvements in service delivery and job creation. This optimism is contingent on the GNU's ability to deliver tangible results.

Philosophy

Constitutional Democracy: The core philosophy is enshrined in its progressive Constitution and Bill of Rights, emphasizing human dignity, equality, and freedom. The current political developments test the resilience of these democratic institutions.

Social Justice and Economic Transformation: A central philosophical struggle involves achieving genuine social justice and economic transformation to address the legacies of apartheid and widespread inequality.

Reconciliation and Nation-Building: South Africa continues its journey of reconciliation and nation-building, striving to overcome historical divisions and forge a shared national identity.

History

Apartheid Era: Decades of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination under apartheid rule until 1994.

Democratic Transition (1994): Marked by the first democratic elections and the election of Nelson Mandela as president.

ANC Dominance: The ANC maintained an outright parliamentary majority for 30 years after 1994.

2024 Election and GNU: The 2024 general election, which saw the ANC lose its majority, is a watershed moment, ushering in a new era of coalition governance.

Social Work

Poverty and Inequality: Social workers are at the forefront of addressing pervasive poverty, unemployment, and inequality.

GBVF Support: Providing support and interventions for victims and survivors of Gender-Based Violence and Femicide is a critical area for social work due to alarmingly high rates.

Child Protection: Protecting vulnerable children from violence, abuse, and neglect, and breaking cycles of inter-generational violence, are key responsibilities.

Community Development: Social workers engage in community development initiatives to build resilience and improve access to basic services.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Free and Diverse Media (with challenges): South Africa generally has a free and diverse media landscape. The transition to a coalition government is a significant focus for media coverage.

Misinformation: The issue of misinformation (e.g., "white genocide" claims) highlights the importance of responsible journalism.

Digital Transformation: Increasing digitalization across government and the economy means digital media platforms are crucial for information dissemination, public engagement, and political discourse.

Education / Teaching

Access and Quality Disparities: Significant disparities in access to quality education persist, often along socio-economic and geographical lines, reflecting the legacy of apartheid.

Youth Unemployment: The education system faces the challenge of adequately preparing young people for the labour market, given high youth unemployment rates.

Safe Learning Environments: Ensuring safe and supportive learning environments is crucial, given the high prevalence of violence in communities.

Skills Development: There's an ongoing emphasis on skills development and vocational training to meet the needs of the evolving economy.
