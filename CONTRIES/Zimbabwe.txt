Dominance of ZANU-PF: As of July 2025, the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) continues to hold power under President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Despite calls for his resignation from some former allies and opposition figures due to corruption concerns, ZANU-PF's grip remains firm, and the opposition, notably the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), is at its weakest point in years, fragmented and boycotting parliamentary by-elections.

Contested Legitimacy and Constitutional Issues: Elections have consistently faced accusations of lacking fairness and being marred by violence, repression, and rigging. There are calls from some quarters for President Mnangagwa to remain in power until 2030, despite a two-term constitutional limit that would see his term end in 2028. This highlights ongoing challenges to constitutionalism and democratic processes.

Shrinking Civic Space and Repression: The government has intensified its crackdown on critics and civil society organizations. The Private Voluntary Organisations Amendment Act, signed into law in April 2025, severely curtails freedom of association and expression, allowing the government to deregister and seize assets of NGOs deemed "politically partisan." This has drawn strong condemnation from international human rights organizations and led to the suspension of EU funding for good governance initiatives.

International Engagement and Sanctions: Zimbabwe continues efforts to re-engage with international financial institutions like the IMF and African Development Bank to address its unsustainable debt levels. However, progress is hampered by persistent concerns regarding governance, human rights, and the rule of law. The US sanctioned First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa and her husband in March 2025 for alleged involvement in illicit gold and diamond networks.

Economic Outlook

Cautious Recovery Amidst Instability (July 2025): Zimbabwe's economy is showing signs of recovery after a sharp slowdown in 2024, which was impacted by a severe drought. Real GDP growth is projected at 6% in 2025 (IMF, World Bank), driven by better climate conditions boosting agriculture (13% growth expected) and strong activity in mining (due to high gold prices and new lithium investments) and tourism.

Hyperinflationary Pressures and Currency Volatility: While inflation has stabilized to an average of 0.5% month-on-month from February to May 2025 after a spike in October 2024, the country continues to grapple with the aftermath of successive bouts of hyperinflation. The local currency (the ZiG, introduced in 2024) quickly lost value after its introduction, and a significant gap persists between the official and parallel market exchange rates (around 20%). The IMF recommends improving the functioning of the official market and eventually moving towards a mono-currency regime by 2030, but warns against premature implementation.

Fiscal Challenges and Debt: Despite improved revenue mobilization (18% of GDP), fiscal pressures are high. The government faces a substantial financing gap for 2025, leading to reliance on T-bills and direct borrowing from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), which expands domestic liquidity and contributes to arrears accumulation. The country's debt levels are unsustainable, and access to IMF financial support remains constrained without a comprehensive debt restructuring plan.

Informal Economy and Corruption: Over 80% of national income is concentrated in the informal sector. Endemic corruption, estimated at over US$2 billion annually, significantly hinders economic progress.

Public Administration

Centralized Control and Weak Rule of Law: Public administration remains highly centralized and prone to political interference. Weak rule of law, patronage systems, and corruption undermine effective governance and service delivery.

Impact of Legislation: The newly enacted Private Voluntary Organisations Amendment Act significantly impacts the operating environment for NGOs, restricting their ability to deliver services and engage in advocacy, particularly those involved in human rights and democratic governance.

Fiscal Management Issues: Despite efforts towards a cash budget, the government struggles with expenditure controls and accumulates domestic arrears, indicating weaknesses in public financial management.

Government Priorities: The government aims to strengthen public financial management, increase revenue collection, and stabilize the currency. However, concerns about corruption, including within government procurement, persist.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Intensified Crackdown and Impunity: There is an intensified crackdown on government critics, civil society organizations, and human rights defenders. Arbitrary arrests, detentions, and politically motivated charges are common. Impunity for abuses is widespread.

Death Penalty Abolition (with caveats): Zimbabwe passed a law in March 2025 officially abolishing the death penalty for ordinary crimes, a significant step. However, clause 7 of the Death Abolition Act, which amends the Defence Act, still needs to be addressed, and the Human Rights Committee has recommended acceding to the Second Optional Protocol to the Covenant aiming at the full abolition of the death penalty.

Concerns over Judicial Independence: While the government states efforts to improve judicial independence, reports indicate concerns about the appointment process for judges and lack of public scrutiny. The Human Rights Committee has raised questions regarding land reform and the independence of the judiciary.

Legislation Impacting Rights: The Private Voluntary Organisations Amendment Act, alongside other laws like the Maintenance of Peace and Order Act, are criticized for restricting fundamental rights to freedom of association and expression.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Religious Freedom with State Scrutiny: While individuals are generally free to practice and express their religious faith, the government's broad powers to monitor and control NGOs (including scrutinizing funding and affiliations) could potentially affect religious organizations, particularly those involved in social or humanitarian work that might be perceived as critical of the state.

Role of Religious Leaders: Some religious leaders have taken public stances on governance issues, with some even receiving luxury cars from politically connected individuals, raising questions about potential co-option or influence. Others, however, remain critical.

Gender Studies

Political Representation: Constitutional amendments in 2025 extended the women's quota for Members of Parliament by two terms and introduced a 30% women's quota for local authorities, indicating efforts to increase female political representation.

Gender-Based Violence: The El Niño-induced drought and deepening poverty are expected to increase the risk of gender-based violence (GBV) and exploitation of children. UNICEF plans interventions to mitigate and prevent GBV.

Child Marriage and Sexual Exploitation: A law enacted in September 2024 raised the age of sexual consent from 16 to 18, aiming to combat sexual exploitation and reinforce existing rules against marriage before 18.

Vulnerability of Women: Women are disproportionately affected by the economic crisis and humanitarian challenges, including food insecurity and limited access to basic services.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Humanitarian Crisis and Poverty: Zimbabwe faces a complex humanitarian crisis, with an estimated 7.6 million people (including 3.5 million children) requiring urgent humanitarian assistance in 2025 due to the El Niño-induced drought, food and nutrition crisis, and public health emergencies (cholera, polio, mpox).

Mass Migration and Brain Drain: The prolonged economic and political crisis has led to a mass exodus of Zimbabweans, resulting in significant brain drain, particularly in healthcare and education. This migration has inadvertently bolstered the survival of the ruling party by reducing potential opposition.

Marginalized Communities: Indigenous groups like the Tshwa and Doma remain among the poorest, facing severe challenges of poverty, unemployment, and limited access to land and resources. Their children experience child labor, hunger, and bullying in schools.

Informal Economy and Social Stratification: The shift to a largely informal economy highlights significant social stratification, with the elite enjoying privileges while the majority struggle with poverty and lack of basic services.

Disillusionment and Division: There is widespread anger and frustration among the populace over the economic situation and perceived government corruption, yet a sense of division and fear of persecution limits mass protests.

Philosophy

Authoritarian Persistence vs. Democratic Aspirations: The core philosophical conflict is between the ruling party's authoritarian tendencies, which prioritize maintaining power, and the democratic aspirations of a populace yearning for free and fair elections, rule of law, and accountability.

Economic Ideologies: The government's attempts to stabilize the economy with new currency introductions and fiscal measures highlight a pragmatic, albeit often inconsistent, approach to economic management. The IMF's recommendations point to the need for deeper structural reforms and institutional integrity.

Resilience and Despair: The Zimbabwean people demonstrate a profound resilience in the face of ongoing hardship, yet this is intertwined with deep despair over the lack of progress and the feeling of having their "vote for a democratic change stolen."

History

Independence (1980): Zimbabwe gained independence from British colonial rule in 1980.

Post-Independence Political Landscape: Since independence, the country's political landscape has been dominated by ZANU-PF, initially under Robert Mugabe, then Emmerson Mnangagwa. This period has been marked by a struggle between democratization and authoritarianism.

Economic Decline and Hyperinflation: The early 2000s saw a period of severe economic decline, land reform controversies, and hyperinflation. The country has faced recurring economic crises.

Shift in Leadership (2017): Robert Mugabe was removed from power in a military-backed transition in 2017, replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa.

2025 Context: The current situation in 2025 is a continuation of the country's struggle with political stability, economic recovery, and human rights, against a backdrop of recurrent natural disasters like the El Niño-induced drought.

Social Work

Humanitarian Crisis Response: Social workers are crucial in responding to the severe humanitarian crisis, providing assistance to the 7.6 million people in need, including those affected by drought, food insecurity, and public health emergencies.

Child Protection: A significant focus is on child protection, addressing issues like child labor, child marriage, and the psychological impact of the crisis on children. UNICEF's 2025 program targets include screening for wasting, providing health care, and offering mental health and psychosocial support.

Vulnerable Populations: Work involves supporting vulnerable households, particularly in rural areas affected by drought, and addressing the needs of marginalized communities like the Tshwa and Doma.

Addressing Gender-Based Violence: Interventions to mitigate and prevent gender-based violence, a heightened risk during crises, are a key component of social work.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Highly Restricted Media Environment: Freedom of expression and the press are severely curtailed. Independent media outlets face immense pressure, and journalists and activists are routinely arrested and detained for critical reporting.

Government Control and Propaganda: The government maintains tight control over information. The media landscape is dominated by state-aligned narratives, and propaganda is used to shape public opinion and discredit dissenting voices.

Risks for Journalists: Journalists operate in a dangerous environment. For example, journalist Blessed Mhlanga was released in May 2025 but still faces charges, highlighting the ongoing risks.

Role of Digital Media: Despite restrictions, digital platforms and social media remain vital for sharing information and for citizens to express their discontent, though these are also subject to surveillance.

Education / Teaching

Crisis in Education: The education system faces severe challenges, including limited resources, dilapidated infrastructure, and significant brain drain of teachers due to economic hardship. This leads to high rates of school dropout and poor educational outcomes.

Impact of Drought: The El Niño-induced drought exacerbates educational challenges, increasing the risk of school dropout due to food insecurity and poverty.

Youth Unemployment: The failing education system contributes to rampant youth unemployment, a major social concern.

Marginalized Children: Indigenous children, like the Tshwa, face specific challenges, including bullying in schools and limited access to educational opportunities.

Library Science

Limited Resources: Libraries, like other public services, are likely to be under-resourced due to the ongoing economic crisis, impacting their ability to provide materials and services.

Access to Information: In a context of restricted media freedom, libraries could play a crucial role in providing access to diverse information, though this might be challenging under the current political climate.

Cultural Preservation: Libraries contribute to preserving Zimbabwe's cultural heritage and history, even amidst national challenges.
