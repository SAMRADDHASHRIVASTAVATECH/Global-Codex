Solomon Islands
Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Parliamentary Democracy with Shifting Alliances: As of July 2025, the Solomon Islands functions as a parliamentary democracy. Following the April 2024 general election, Jeremiah Manele was elected Prime Minister in May 2024. His government, known as the "Government for National Unity and Transformation" (GNUT), is a coalition that aims to provide stability after a period of significant geopolitical shifts. The fluid nature of political party membership and a history of no-confidence motions in parliament mean that the political landscape remains dynamic.

Strategic Shift Towards China and Balancing Act: The Solomon Islands' foreign policy under the previous government (Manasseh Sogavare) saw a significant shift in diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 2019, followed by a controversial security pact with China in 2022. While Prime Minister Manele has indicated a desire to "re-engage" with traditional partners like Australia and the United States, balancing these relationships with the deepening ties to China remains a central strategic challenge. The launch of the National Security Strategy 2025 aims to provide a comprehensive roadmap for protecting sovereignty and promoting sustainable development in a complex global environment, addressing both traditional and non-traditional security threats.

Regional Leadership (PIF Chairmanship): In 2025, the Solomon Islands is slated to assume the chair of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), the region's primary multilateral organization, and host the PIF Leaders Meeting in Honiara. This role will significantly elevate its regional profile and could influence regional discussions, particularly concerning geostrategic competition in the Pacific. Concerns have been raised by some observers about potential PRC influence over the PIF proceedings during the Solomon Islands' chairmanship.

Development Priorities: The government's national policy rests on four key pillars: Economic Transformation, Unity and Stability, Infrastructure Development, and Human Capital Development. The National Development Strategy 2016-2035 provides a long-term framework.

Economic Outlook

Moderate Growth, Diversification Challenges: The Solomon Islands' economy continues to experience moderate, but positive, economic growth, though significantly below national development targets of 5% by 2025 and 7% by 2030. The IMF forecasts growth barely exceeding 3% by 2029, meaning it will only slightly outpace population growth. Growth in the first half of 2024 was supported by fishing, forestry, manufacturing, and construction.

Fiscal Challenges and Debt: While debt levels remain relatively low internationally, government external debt grew by 129% and domestic debt by 326% between September 2019 and September 2024, reaching approximately 12% and 8% of GDP in 2024, respectively. The fiscal deficit is expected by the IMF to be 3.3% in 2025, driven by infrastructure investment and government priorities. Concerns exist regarding the government's liquidity situation as cash reserves have been receding. Efforts are underway to strengthen fiscal management and transparency, with a key recommendation to adhere to international standard practices for Public Financial Management (PFM) by December 2025.

Inflation: Inflation, which peaked in November 2022 at 9.7%, has subsided, with the latest estimates for November 2024 showing 4.3%. It is expected to remain low, leading the central bank to adopt an accommodative monetary policy stance.

Tourism and Remittances: While detailed forecasts for 2025 are not readily available, the broader Pacific region is experiencing a slowdown in tourism as post-COVID momentum fades. Remittance inflows are becoming increasingly important, now exceeding 5% of the country's GDP, with expectations to rise further due to expanding labor mobility programs.

Resource Dependence: The economy remains heavily reliant on natural resources, particularly logging and fisheries, making it vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations and unsustainable practices. Diversification is a critical long-term challenge.

Public Administration

Fiscal Management Reforms: The Solomon Islands is actively navigating a critical phase in enhancing its fiscal governance structures. Challenges persist in the efficiency and effectiveness of fiscal management, with non-adherence to international standards causing burdens in financial reporting. Compliance with the PFMA 2013 by December 2025 is a key goal to achieve minimum fiscal transparency.

National Security Strategy: The launch of the National Security Strategy 2025 highlights a focus on strengthening institutions and governance frameworks to address various security threats, including crime and corruption.

Challenges with FMIS: The Financial Management Information System (FMIS), upgraded in 2021, has not functioned as anticipated, posing a significant challenge to fiscal data governance and timely financial reporting.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Common Law System: The legal system of the Solomon Islands is based on English common law.

Justice Sector Challenges: The justice system faces challenges related to capacity, efficiency, and access to justice, particularly for remote and vulnerable communities.

Transitional Justice: The country has a history of conflict and is engaged in ongoing efforts for peacebuilding and reconciliation, often supported by international organizations like the International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), which works to obtain acknowledgment and redress for human rights violations and build democratic institutions.

Human Rights Concerns (as of 2025):

Climate Change Impacts on Rights: Sea level rise and other climate impacts are directly undermining human rights, particularly the right to food and secure land tenure for Indigenous communities like Walande. Insecure land tenure, limited access to land, and inadequate government support compound these issues. Planned relocation efforts often lack adequate government support.

Access to Education: Despite government policies, equal access to quality education remains an ongoing issue, particularly for children with disabilities and those in rural areas, largely due to cost barriers for secondary education and a lack of qualified teachers.

Freedom of Expression and Assembly: While fundamental rights are enshrined, practical limitations and past instances of restrictions are noted.

Corruption: Endemic corruption remains a significant issue, undermining trust in public officials and institutions.

Death Penalty: The death penalty has been abolished.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Predominantly Christian: Christianity is the dominant religion in the Solomon Islands, with various denominations present.

Role of Churches: Churches play a significant role in community life, social cohesion, and often in local justice and reconciliation efforts. Religious leaders are important stakeholders in peacebuilding initiatives.

Gender Studies

Women's Participation: The National Security Strategy 2025 aims to "promote Gender equality and empowerment of women and youth in peacebuilding and conflict resolution."

Economic Empowerment: The World Bank's June 2025 Pacific Economic Update highlights that boosting women's participation in the workforce is a "powerful opportunity" for the Pacific, suggesting that closing gender gaps in labor markets could significantly increase GDP per capita over the long term. This indicates that while there may be cultural or structural barriers, there is an increasing recognition of women's economic potential.

Data and Inclusive Policies: The World Bank project to safeguard financial lifelines emphasizes collecting gender-disaggregated financial access data to help shape inclusive financial policies, indicating a move towards more data-driven gender initiatives.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Melanesian Cultural Diversity: The Solomon Islands is culturally diverse, predominantly Melanesian, with numerous distinct languages and customs across its many islands.

Traditional Governance and Customary Law: Traditional governance structures and customary law continue to play a significant role alongside formal government institutions, particularly at the community level.

Land Tenure Issues: Insecure land tenure and limited access to land are critical social and human rights issues, exacerbated by climate change and impacting Indigenous communities' traditional livelihoods.

Social Cohesion: Promoting internal security and social cohesion, including addressing unresolved tensions and grievances through peace agreements and community-based reconciliation initiatives, remains a key government priority.

Philosophy

Adaptation and Resilience: A core philosophical theme in the Solomon Islands, particularly in the face of climate change, is adaptation and building resilience. The Human Rights Watch report highlights the "last-resort adaptation" of planned relocation for communities facing sea level rise.

Sovereignty and Self-Determination: The country's foreign policy reflects a desire to assert its sovereignty and self-determination in navigating complex geopolitical choices, seeking to balance relations with both traditional partners and emerging powers like China.

Collective Security and Well-being: The National Security Strategy 2025 underscores a philosophy of collective security, deeply intertwined with the well-being of the people, the resilience of institutions, and the preservation of the natural environment.

History

Pre-Colonial Era: Inhabited by Melanesian peoples for thousands of years, with diverse tribal societies.

Colonial Era: Became a British protectorate in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Significant World War II battlegrounds (e.g., Guadalcanal).

Independence (1978): Gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1978.

Ethnic Tensions and RAMSI (1998-2017): Experienced a period of significant ethnic conflict (the "Tensions") from 1998 to 2003, which led to the intervention of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), an Australian-led multinational peacekeeping and development force that operated until 2017.

Recent Geopolitical Shifts: The last decade has been marked by a significant shift in foreign policy, culminating in the switch of diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China in 2019 and the signing of a security pact with China in 2022, which has profound implications for regional geopolitics in 2025.

Social Work

Community-Based Support: Social work efforts often focus on community-based initiatives, particularly in rural areas, given the reliance on traditional social structures.

Addressing Vulnerability: Addressing issues such as poverty, limited access to education, and the impacts of climate change on livelihoods are key areas for social work intervention.

Reconciliation and Peacebuilding: Social workers play a role in supporting reconciliation efforts and addressing the social trauma and divisions stemming from past conflicts.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Media Environment: The media landscape includes a mix of state-owned and private media outlets. While information is available, challenges can exist in terms of reach, resources, and potential influence.

Digital Connectivity: Improving digital infrastructure and payment systems is a focus for economic development, which will also impact how information is disseminated and accessed.

Strategic Communication: The government's communication unit is actively involved in preparing for national events like the 47th Independence Anniversary celebrations in July 2025 and disseminating information about national strategies.

Education / Teaching

Access and Quality Challenges: Despite government policy commitment, equitable access to quality education remains a significant challenge. Primary school attendance rates are around 65.4% overall, with rural areas facing greater difficulties. Secondary school fees are often too expensive for families.

Teacher Training: A high percentage of teachers are unqualified, and there's a need for more certified professionals and adequate infrastructure.

Education for Children with Disabilities: Limited access to education for children with disabilities is a particular human rights concern, rooted in both cultural perceptions and systemic barriers.

Human Capital Development: The government's National Policy prioritizes "Human Capital Development," signaling a recognition of the need for improved education and skills to drive long-term growth.

Library Science

Preservation of Knowledge: Libraries play a crucial role in preserving the diverse cultural heritage and traditional knowledge of the many ethnic groups in the Solomon Islands.

Access to Information and Literacy: They are vital for providing access to educational resources and promoting literacy, particularly in a country facing challenges in educational attainment.

Community Role: Libraries can serve as important community hubs, supporting educational initiatives and providing spaces for learning and cultural exchange.
