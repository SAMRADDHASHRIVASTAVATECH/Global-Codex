Post-Assad Transitional Government (July 2025): As of July 2025, Syria is governed by a transitional government led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa, following the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024. Mohammed al-Bashir served as Prime Minister until March 2025, with a new Prime Minister in place subsequently. This new leadership presents a crucial, yet complex, opportunity for a political transition.

Challenges of Transition and Fragmentation: The country is grappling with profound political fragmentation and the enormous task of establishing a stable, inclusive, and legitimate government after years of civil war and authoritarian rule. The new interim constitution, adopted in March 2025, aims to guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms, but critics note its consolidation of power under the presidency with few checks and balances.

Security Landscape: While the central conflict with the Assad regime has ended, security remains precarious. Continuous hostilities persist in northern and southern parts of the country, and recently in coastal areas, leading to ongoing displacement and protection concerns. Israeli airstrikes and threats of further military intervention across Syrian territory continue to jeopardize the country's fragile security situation. There are reports of ambushes by Assad loyalists and continued activity by groups like Islamic State.

Foreign Policy and Sanctions Lifting: There has been a significant shift in international engagement with Syria following the fall of the Assad regime.

US Sanctions Revocation: Effective July 1, 2025, the U.S. has revoked broad sanctions on Syria, including those imposed by several Executive Orders and waivers under the Caesar Act, aiming to benefit the Syrian people. However, sanctions linked to the Assad family and their associates, as well as those related to serious human rights abuse, proliferation of narcotics trafficking (particularly Captagon), and actions threatening Syria's peace or territorial integrity, remain in place under a new "Promoting Accountability for Assad and Regional Stabilization Sanctions (PAARSS)" program.

EU and UK Sanctions Easing: The EU and UK have also lifted most of their economic sanctions targeting Syria's energy and transport sectors, as well as certain import/export restrictions and financial services measures. This is aimed at encouraging political reform and supporting reconstruction. However, some targeted sanctions related to the former Assad government and human rights violators remain.

International Re-engagement: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE have been among the first nations to endorse Syria's new leadership, with President al-Sharaa invited to visit these countries to secure economic support. The World Bank has stated Syria is eligible for new loans after its outstanding debt was cleared, allowing it to re-engage.

UN Security Council Focus: The UN Security Council is expected to hold monthly meetings on political and humanitarian developments in Syria, with a main priority being to ensure the interim government pursues a credible, transparent, and inclusive political process based on UN Resolution 2254.

Economic Outlook

Catastrophic State with Hopes for Reconstruction: Syria's economy is in a catastrophic state following years of conflict, with 90% of the population living in poverty and over half facing severe food insecurity. The country's GDP had shrunk by 85% by 2023. However, the fall of the Assad regime has brought a major wave of international investment and aid commitments, creating cautious optimism for reconstruction.

New Investments and Aid Pledges: Major commitments include a $7 billion energy infrastructure deal led by Qatar's UCC Holding, a $6.5 billion aid pledge from international donors, and an $800 million port development agreement with Dubai-based DP World. The Damascus Securities Exchange has reopened.

Massive Reconstruction Needs: Despite the influx, Syria's reconstruction needs are immense, estimated between $400 billion (World Bank) and $1 trillion (Syrian Minister of Economy and Industry). The UNDP estimated in February 2025 that it could take half a century to recover to pre-war economic levels.

Fiscal Challenges and Inflation: The 2025 budget, while nominally larger, reflects the steep depreciation of the Syrian pound, with its real purchasing power significantly decreased compared to pre-conflict levels. The government's focus on fiscal stability over immediate relief includes reducing subsidies, even for essentials. Deficit reduction is a priority, but "intake from reserves" (money printing) continues to fuel inflation.

Humanitarian Economic Impact: Economic hardships persist across governorates due to liquidity shortages, scarce electricity, and limited public services. The conflict has decimated the labor force due to mass displacement (7.2 million internally displaced, 6.2 million refugees). Cash-for-work programs are being introduced to provide immediate employment and rebuild infrastructure.

Public Administration

Transitional Governance and Reform Efforts: The new transitional government, formed in March 2025, is attempting to establish new administrative structures and processes. This includes efforts to restore control over state assets, such as the port of Tartus (abrogating a 2019 agreement with Russia).

Challenges of State Capacity: Years of conflict have severely eroded state capacity, leading to significant challenges in providing basic services, maintaining infrastructure, and collecting revenue.

Security Sector Reform: Reform of the security sector is a fundamental step in transitional justice, requiring new doctrinal frameworks that integrate human rights principles into daily operations.

Digitalization and Service Delivery: The vast destruction and displacement mean that rebuilding public administration will require significant investment in infrastructure and human resources, as well as efforts to digitalize services where possible to improve efficiency and access.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Focus on Transitional Justice and Accountability: The new government has publicly committed to prioritizing justice and truth measures. Key developments include the establishment of a National High Commission for Missing Persons (February 2025) and a Transitional Justice Commission (March 2025). France and other international actors welcome these steps but emphasize the need for transparency, victim-centered approaches, and genuine consultation with civil society.

Ongoing Human Rights Violations and Impunity: Despite the change in government, serious human rights concerns persist.

Sectarian Violence: Mass killings, largely of Alawites in coastal regions (March 2025), and targeted violence against the Druze community (May 2025) raise fears of revenge attacks and sectarianism.

Accountability for Past and Present Crimes: Amnesty International and Human Rights First stress that accountability must extend to all crimes committed by all warring parties, not just the former Assad regime. Arbitrary arrests of individuals accused of gross human rights violations during the Assad regime's rule have been reported (May 2025).

Torture and Detention: There is an urgent need to reform Syria's judicial and security systems, prevent arbitrary detention, ensure judicial oversight, and provide protection for detainees. The Frankfurt Tribunal (universal jurisdiction trials) serves as a model for documenting systematic torture and establishing criminal responsibility within state-sponsored violence.

Child Recruitment: Concerns remain about the recruitment of children into armed groups.

Legal Reforms: Reform should involve repealing laws inconsistent with international law and enacting legislation safeguarding human rights, fair trials, freedom from torture and disappearance, and non-discrimination.

International Cooperation: There are calls for Syria to cooperate with international organizations like the IIIM (International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism), Commission of Inquiry, ICMP (International Commission on Missing Persons), and ICRC, and to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Religious Diversity and Sectarian Tensions: Syria is a religiously diverse country, with Sunni Muslims forming the majority, alongside significant Alawite, Christian (various denominations), Druze, and other minority communities. The recent mass killings of Alawites and violence against the Druze community underscore the dangerous resurgence of sectarian tensions.

Role of Religious Minorities: The US policy statement of July 1, 2025, emphasizes a united Syria that ensures the security of its religious and ethnic minorities, recognizing their crucial role in regional security and prosperity. This highlights the ongoing concern for the protection and rights of these groups in the post-Assad era.

Gender Studies

Heightened Vulnerability of Women and Girls: Women and girls in Syria continue to be at severe risk of gender-based violence (GBV), which remains largely under-reported due to social stigma and lack of protection services.

Regressive Attitudes and Lack of Representation: Human Rights First's April 2025 report noted concerning developments regarding gender equity, including a lack of women in the transitional government cabinet and disturbing reports of regressive attitudes and efforts to segregate or remove women from positions of influence, including in the judiciary.

Impact of Displacement: Displaced women and girls face unique vulnerabilities, including increased risk of violence, exploitation, and limited access to essential services.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Shattered Social Fabric: Years of conflict have profoundly shattered Syria's social fabric, leading to massive internal and external displacement, destruction of communities, and deep divisions.

Ethnic and Sectarian Divides: The conflict has exacerbated existing ethnic and sectarian divides. Recent violence against minority groups (Alawites, Druze) indicates a serious risk of further sectarian strife, posing a significant challenge to national unity and reconciliation.

Cultural Heritage at Risk: The war has taken a heavy toll on Syria's rich cultural heritage, with historical sites and artifacts destroyed or looted.

Returnee Challenges: Internally displaced persons and refugees returning home face immense challenges, including unreliable access to electricity, clean water, healthcare, essential services, and housing, compounded by a lack of economic opportunities. This impacts social reintegration.

Philosophy

Justice and Accountability in Transition: A central philosophical challenge in post-Assad Syria is how to achieve meaningful truth, justice, and reparation for victims of widespread atrocities committed by all parties to the conflict, while simultaneously fostering reconciliation and preventing future cycles of violence.

Rebuilding a State: The country is grappling with the fundamental philosophical question of how to rebuild a legitimate state that protects human rights, provides security, and ensures equitable development for all its citizens after years of state failure and fragmentation.

Sovereignty vs. Humanitarian Intervention: The ongoing humanitarian crisis and continued security concerns raise philosophical debates about the balance between national sovereignty and the international community's responsibility to protect.

History

Ancient Civilizations: Syria boasts a rich history dating back to ancient civilizations, including the Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, each leaving a significant cultural legacy.

Islamic Conquest and Ottoman Rule: Became part of the Islamic caliphates in the 7th century and later a province of the Ottoman Empire for centuries.

French Mandate and Independence (1946): After World War I, it became a French mandate and gained independence in 1946.

Ba'athist Rule and Assad Dynasty: From 1963, Syria was dominated by the Ba'ath Party, leading to the long-standing rule of Hafez al-Assad and then his son, Bashar al-Assad, characterized by authoritarianism.

Civil War (2011-2024): The 2011 uprising, part of the Arab Spring, escalated into a devastating civil war with multiple international actors involved, leading to massive casualties, displacement, and destruction.

Fall of Assad Regime (December 2024): A major turning point occurred in December 2024 with the collapse of the Assad regime, marking the end of the Assad dynasty's rule and opening a new, uncertain chapter for the country.

Social Work

Largest Humanitarian Crisis: Social workers are at the forefront of responding to one of the world's largest and most complex humanitarian crises. The UN and humanitarian partners are appealing for $3.19 billion to cover immediate needs for 10.3 million people in 2025.

Addressing Basic Needs: Providing essential services such as food, water, shelter, and healthcare to millions of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees is a monumental task.

Psychosocial Support: Decades of conflict and displacement have led to widespread trauma. Social workers are critical in providing psychosocial support to individuals, families, and communities, particularly to women, children, and those affected by violence and loss.

Protection Concerns: Addressing protection concerns, including gender-based violence, child protection, and ensuring the safety of vulnerable populations in conflict-affected areas, is a priority.

Reintegration and Livelihoods: Supporting the reintegration of returnees and building sustainable livelihoods for affected populations are crucial long-term goals for social work.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Challenging Environment for Media: Despite the change in government, Syria remains a highly challenging and dangerous environment for journalists. Information control, risks of arbitrary arrest, and violence persist.

Access to Information: The humanitarian response document from June 2025 highlights that the US Executive Order suspending humanitarian activities in January 2025 (now largely revoked) had "severely impacted humanitarian organizations and sectors," leading to "significant gaps in coordination and information management." This underscores the ongoing challenges for communication and information flow.

Combating Disinformation: In a highly fractured political and social landscape, combating disinformation and providing accurate, unbiased information to the public is critical.

Education / Teaching

Devastated System: Syria's education system has been devastated by the conflict, with widespread destruction of schools, displacement of teachers, and millions of children out of school.

Access Challenges: Ensuring access to education for displaced children, particularly those in informal settlements and camps, is an immense challenge.

Curriculum Reform: With a new transitional government, there will be a need for curriculum reform to promote peace, reconciliation, and democratic values, moving away from past ideologies.

Humanitarian Education Needs: Education efforts are heavily reliant on humanitarian aid, which remains severely underfunded.

Library Science

Cultural Heritage at Risk: Syria's rich historical and cultural heritage, including its libraries and archives, has suffered immense damage and looting during the conflict. Preserving what remains and restoring damaged collections is a monumental task.

Access to Knowledge: The destruction of libraries and educational infrastructure has severely limited access to knowledge and information for the population, particularly for children and students.

Role in Reconstruction: In the long term, libraries will be crucial for rebuilding cultural memory, supporting education, and fostering a sense of national identity and shared heritage in a post-conflict Syria.

International Cooperation: International efforts and expertise will be vital for supporting the recovery and restoration of Syria's library and archival institutions.
