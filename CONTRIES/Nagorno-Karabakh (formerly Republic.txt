Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Current Status: Under Azerbaijani Control (July 2025): Nagorno-Karabakh, also known as Artsakh, is currently under the full control of Azerbaijan. Following a swift military offensive in September 2023, the ethnic Armenian self-declared Republic of Artsakh officially dissolved itself, effective January 1, 2024.

Mass Exodus of Ethnic Armenians: The military offensive led to the rapid and near-total exodus of almost the entire ethnic Armenian population (over 100,000 out of an estimated 120,000) from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.

No International Recognition of Artsakh: The Republic of Artsakh was never recognized by any UN member state, including Armenia, despite its de facto independence for decades. International bodies, including the UN Security Council and the EU, recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as a region of Azerbaijan.

Peace Talks with Armenia: Azerbaijan and Armenia have been engaged in peace talks following the 2023 events, with both sides indicating in March 2025 that a draft peace agreement had been finalized. However, the timeline for signing remains unclear, as Azerbaijan insists on Armenia amending its constitution to remove any implicit references to territorial claims over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has indicated a willingness to do so, potentially through a referendum.

Azerbaijani Integration and Resettlement: Azerbaijan is focused on the integration and economic reconstruction of the region, including resettling ethnic Azeris who were displaced during previous Nagorno-Karabakh Wars.

Withdrawal of Russian Peacekeepers: Russian peacekeepers, stationed in the region after the 2020 war, completed their withdrawal in June 2025, ahead of their original 2025 mandate.

International Calls for Dialogue and Return: The European Parliament, along with the US, France, and Russia (OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs), have repeatedly called on Azerbaijan to engage in dialogue with representatives of the displaced Nagorno-Karabakh population and ensure their safe and dignified return. Switzerland has also established a platform for dialogue.

Economic Outlook

Devastation and Reconstruction: The economy of Nagorno-Karabakh as it existed under Armenian control has collapsed due to the displacement of nearly its entire population and the shift to Azerbaijani administration. Azerbaijan is now focused on the economic reconstruction of the region.

Integration into Azerbaijani Economy: The territory is being integrated into Azerbaijan's economic framework. Details on specific economic projects or conditions within the depopulated region in July 2025 are limited, but the focus is on rebuilding infrastructure and preparing for the resettlement of ethnic Azeris.

Humanitarian Concerns (for Displaced): The displaced Armenian population in Armenia faces significant economic challenges, with many residing in overcrowded temporary housing and lacking access to insulation, heating, or facilities. They await compensation and long-term support programs to rebuild their lives.

Public Administration

Dissolution of Artsakh Institutions: The local political, legal, and civic institutions of the Republic of Artsakh were officially dissolved on January 1, 2024, following the Azerbaijani offensive.

Azerbaijani Administration: Public administration in Nagorno-Karabakh is now conducted under the direct authority of the Azerbaijani government. Azerbaijani authorities are focused on establishing their administrative structures and integrating the region.

No Local Representation: With the departure of nearly the entire Armenian population, there are no locally elected governing bodies or political opposition as existed under Artsakh.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Azerbaijani Legal System: The legal system of Nagorno-Karabakh is now under the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan.

Property Rights Disputes: A major legal issue revolves around the property rights of the displaced ethnic Armenian population. Azerbaijan has stated it is integrating the region, but there are ongoing international and legal discussions regarding the rights of return and compensation for the displaced.

International Court of Justice Cases: Armenia and Azerbaijan have filed cases with the International Court of Justice, accusing each other of various violations, including ethnic cleansing.

Concerns over Accountability: Human rights groups have raised concerns about the accountability for actions during and after the 2023 offensive, and the lack of an independent process for addressing human rights violations.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Threat to Armenian Christian Heritage: The Armenian Christian cultural and religious heritage sites in Nagorno-Karabakh are at extreme risk of destruction, with reports in May 2025 documenting a 75% increase in destroyed sites since 2023. These include churches, monasteries, cemeteries, and khachkars.

Concerns over Erasure of Identity: There is an ongoing campaign to erase Armenian culture and religion in Artsakh through physical destruction, disappearance of movable cultural objects, and the promotion of a false narrative regarding the region's Christian history.

International Condemnation: This has been denounced by various international bodies, including the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, the Council of Europe, and the European Parliament.

Gender Studies

Disproportionate Impact on Women and Girls: Of the over 100,000 ethnic Armenians who fled Nagorno-Karabakh, more than 50% are women and girls, highlighting the gendered impact of forced displacement. They face specific challenges related to their displacement and integration into Armenia.

Vulnerability of Displaced Women: Displaced women and girls often experience heightened vulnerabilities, including increased risks of violence, limited access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities in their new locations.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Ethnic Cleansing: The events of September 2023, which saw the mass exodus of ethnic Armenians, have been widely described as ethnic cleansing by various human rights organizations and international bodies.

Demographic Shift: Nagorno-Karabakh, once predominantly Armenian, is now largely depopulated of its indigenous Armenian inhabitants. Azerbaijan is focused on resettling ethnic Azeris in the region.

Cultural Erasure: The systematic destruction and alteration of Armenian cultural and religious sites by Azerbaijan is a major concern, representing an attempt to erase the Armenian historical and cultural presence in the region. This includes both immovable and movable cultural objects.

Trauma and Displacement: The forced displacement has created significant trauma and ongoing challenges for the displaced Armenian population, who are attempting to rebuild their lives in Armenia.

Philosophy

Self-Determination vs. Territorial Integrity: The long-standing philosophical debate over the right to self-determination for the ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh versus Azerbaijan's territorial integrity has, for now, been resolved by force in favor of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity.

Justice and Right of Return: A new philosophical and moral imperative has emerged: the right of return for the displaced population and the pursuit of justice for alleged human rights violations and cultural destruction. This is seen by many as a "test of conscience" for the international community.

Historical Revisionism: The Azerbaijani campaign to erase Armenian cultural and religious heritage and promote a "false narrative" about the region's history presents a philosophical challenge related to truth, memory, and identity.

History

Ancient Armenian Presence: The region has a long history of Armenian habitation, with Christian Armenian churches and monuments dating back thousands of years.

Soviet Era: During the Soviet era, Nagorno-Karabakh was an ethnic Armenian autonomous oblast within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic.

First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988-1994): As the Soviet Union dissolved, the region declared its intention to join Armenia, leading to a full-scale war that resulted in de facto Armenian control over Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding territories. The self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh emerged.

Second Nagorno-Karabakh War (2020): Azerbaijan launched a major offensive in 2020, reclaiming significant territory. A Russian-brokered ceasefire agreement left Armenia with only a portion of Karabakh and established the Lachin Corridor for transit, monitored by Russian peacekeepers.

Lachin Corridor Blockade (2022-2023): Azerbaijan blockaded the Lachin Corridor from December 2022, severely impacting the humanitarian situation in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Azerbaijani Offensive and Dissolution (September 2023 - January 2024): In September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a decisive "anti-terrorist" offensive, leading to the surrender of Artsakh forces and the mass exodus of Armenians. The Republic of Artsakh officially dissolved on January 1, 2024.

Post-2023 Developments (to July 2025): Since then, Azerbaijan has been integrating the region, Russian peacekeepers have withdrawn, and Armenia and Azerbaijan are working towards a peace deal, though significant obstacles remain, particularly regarding the Armenian constitution and the Zangezur Corridor.

Social Work

Refugee Support in Armenia: Social work efforts are concentrated in Armenia, assisting the over 100,000 displaced Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh. This includes providing shelter, food, psychological support, and helping them integrate into Armenian society.

Addressing Trauma: The experience of forced displacement and loss of homeland has created significant trauma, requiring extensive social and psychological support services for the affected population.

Long-Term Integration: Social workers are crucial in helping refugees with long-term integration, including access to housing, employment, healthcare, and education.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Shifting Narratives: The media landscape surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh is dominated by competing narratives from Azerbaijan and Armenia, with international media reporting on the unfolding humanitarian situation and the political implications.

Concerns over Information Control: Human rights reports indicate concerns about the suppression of independent media and freedom of expression within Azerbaijan, which now extends to Nagorno-Karabakh.

Digital Disinformation: There is a campaign to promote false narratives about Armenian culture and history in the digital environment, further complicating objective reporting.

Education / Teaching

Disruption of Education: The education system in Nagorno-Karabakh, previously operated by Artsakh, has been completely disrupted.

Education for Displaced Children: Efforts are focused on integrating the thousands of displaced Armenian children into the Armenian education system.

Azerbaijani Educational Integration: Azerbaijan will be establishing its own educational institutions and curriculum in the region.

Library Science

Risk to Cultural Collections: Libraries and cultural institutions in Nagorno-Karabakh, which housed significant Armenian historical and cultural collections, are now under Azerbaijani control. There are significant concerns about the fate and preservation of these collections.

Documentation of Loss: Library and information science professionals, particularly those associated with Armenian cultural heritage organizations, are involved in documenting the destruction and potential loss of cultural property.

Supporting Displaced Communities: Libraries in Armenia are likely playing a role in supporting the displaced population by providing information and resources to aid their integration.
