Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Fragile Federal Parliamentary Republic with Constitutional Crisis (July 2025): Somalia operates as a federal parliamentary republic, but its political landscape is marked by deep divisions and a constitutional crisis. Alarm bells are ringing ahead of the 2026 presidential election, with concerns over accelerating constitutional changes and governance practices that risk derailing democratic progress. Critics, including the CAHDI Party of Somalia (a Liberal International member), have raised serious concerns about the federal government's unilateral decision-making, exclusion of key stakeholders, and politically motivated appointments to the electoral commission, warning of a potential for authoritarian drift.


Shifting Electoral Model: President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud is determined to replace the long-standing clan-based indirect voting system with a one-person, one-vote model for the upcoming 2026 presidential election. This move has deepened political rifts, with various political forces mobilizing opposition, fearing disruption to the delicate clan-based power-sharing arrangement. The President also launched a new political party, the Justice and Solidarity Party, ahead of the 2026 election, further fueling political tensions.


Security Transition and State Building: A major strategic challenge for Somalia in 2025 is the ongoing security transition from the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) to the new African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM), and ultimately, the full assumption of security responsibilities by the Somali National Armed Forces (SNAF). This transition is fraught with complexities, including funding shortfalls for AUSSOM and the need to bolster SNAF capabilities against Al-Shabaab.


Strategic Leadership - National Transformation Plan (2025-29) and Centennial Vision (2060): Despite the challenges, Somalia has a long-term strategic vision encapsulated in its National Transformation Plan (NTP) 2025-29 and the Centennial Vision 2060. These plans aim for economic transformation, sustained growth, and reduced fragility, with a focus on strengthening economic institutions, domestic revenue mobilization, and private sector development.



Foreign Policy:

Regional Engagement: Somalia remains an active participant in regional bodies like the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and engages with the African Union (AU) on security and political developments.

International Partnerships: The country continues to rely heavily on international partners, including the United Nations (UN), European Union (EU), and individual states (e.g., the United States), for security assistance, humanitarian aid, and development support. The UN Security Council is closely monitoring the situation, particularly concerning AUSSOM operations and the activation of new resolutions for support.

Ethiopian Relations: Relations with Ethiopia remain sensitive following a contentious memorandum of understanding signed by Ethiopia with Somaliland in early 2024, which Somalia views as an act of aggression and a violation of its sovereignty.

Economic Outlook

Positive Outlook but Aid Uncertainty: Somalia's economy showed strong performance in 2024, with 4.0% growth supported by agriculture, remittances, and declining commodity prices. The 2025 Somalia Economic Update by the World Bank indicates a positive outlook, but growth is set to slow down to around 3-4% due to increased uncertainty regarding foreign aid, on which Somalia is heavily reliant.


Fiscal Reforms and Revenue Mobilization: The Federal Government of Somalia recorded a small fiscal surplus in 2024 due to prudent expenditure management and improved revenue collection. The 2025 Budget Policy Framework Paper (FPB) aims to continue strengthening security and boosting SMEs and household incomes. Key reforms include ongoing customs modernization, a new income tax law, and improved enforcement of sales and income tax collection to increase domestic revenue mobilization.

Inflation: Annual average inflation fell below 6% in 2024 and is projected to be around 4.6% in 2025, aided by softer global commodity prices.

Debt Relief (HIPC): Reforms implemented within the context of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative are paying off, supporting sustained, albeit modest, growth.

Sectoral Growth Potential: Sectors like digital technology, agribusiness, fisheries, energy, and manufacturing are expected to experience significant growth, creating job opportunities.

Humanitarian Challenges and Food Insecurity: Despite some improvements due to better rainfall and humanitarian assistance, the humanitarian situation remains dire. An estimated 4.6 million people are projected to face crisis-level hunger (IPC Phase 3 or worse) in 2025, and acute malnutrition affects 1.8 million children. Extreme weather patterns, including heavy rains and floods, continue to displace thousands and destroy livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity.

Public Administration

Institutional Reforms: Efforts are underway to build stronger economic institutions, including strengthening public financial management, investment management, and debt management capacity.

Digitalization Efforts: The Ministry of Finance's 2025 budget strategy includes expanding digitalization efforts, particularly in customs reforms. The Somali National Bureau of Statistics (SNBS) launched a modernized Consumer Price Index (CPI) in May 2025, representing a significant step towards improved data governance.


Constitutional Review Process: The constitutional review process is a major focus, but it is currently a source of political tension, with concerns about unilateral decision-making and lack of inclusivity in institutional reforms and appointments.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Common Law System: Somalia's legal system is based on common law.

Justice Sector Challenges: The justice sector faces immense challenges. The government has not reviewed the country's outdated penal code or established a national human rights commission.

Military Courts and Executions: Military courts continue to sentence people to death, including individuals accused of Al-Shabaab affiliation and killings. Human Rights Watch reported that in August 2024, Puntland executed 10 people, four of whom were children at the time of the alleged offense.


Human Rights Concerns (as of July 2025):

Al-Shabaab's Impact: Al-Shabaab remains the primary perpetrator of human rights abuses, using improvised explosive devices (IEDs), suicide bombings, shelling, and targeted assassinations, resulting in hundreds of civilian deaths and injuries. They continue to target, kill, and intimidate media workers.

Government Operations: Government offensives against Al-Shabaab have also led to civilian deaths, injuries, and displacement. Amnesty International reported strikes supported by Turkish-made drones killed 23 civilians, including 14 children, in March 2024.


Freedom of Expression: The space for exercising the right to freedom of expression is severely restricted. Journalists reporting on security and political issues are intimidated, beaten, arrested, and detained with impunity.

Sexual Violence: Conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence continues to affect mostly internally displaced women and girls. Somalia has not ratified key international conventions on women's rights like CEDAW or the Maputo Protocol.

Displacement and Humanitarian Access: Around half of the 350,000 people internally displaced between January and October 2024 fled conflict and insecurity. Tens of thousands have been forcibly evicted. Humanitarian agencies face serious challenges delivering aid due to conflict, targeted attacks on aid workers, and restrictions imposed by warring parties.


Inter-Clan Conflict: Escalating inter-clan conflict, particularly in central Somalia over increasingly scarce resources, continues to cause civilian deaths, injuries, and displacement.

Death Penalty: The death penalty is still used.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Predominantly Sunni Muslim: Somalia is overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. Islam plays a central role in Somali society, culture, and law.


Islamic Law (Sharia): Islamic law (Sharia) is a foundational element of the legal system and social norms.

Extremism: Al-Shabaab, an extremist group, uses a radical interpretation of Islam to justify its violence and control, posing a significant challenge to the state and its people.

Gender Studies

Vulnerability of Women and Girls: Women and girls are disproportionately affected by conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence. Somalia's failure to ratify key international women's rights conventions (CEDAW, Maputo Protocol) remains a significant concern.


Political Participation: While the government has introduced a quota system requiring 30% of candidates to be women and 5% to be persons with disabilities in electoral processes, the UN expert on human rights noted that clan-based structures entrenched in the country's governance system may ultimately determine election outcomes.

Anti-Female Genital Mutilation Acts: Some regional states have adopted Anti-Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) Acts, a positive step, but a federal law has not yet been enacted.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Clan-Based Society: Somali society is largely organized around clan structures, which historically have played a significant role in social organization, conflict resolution, and political representation. However, the clan-based political system is also a source of ongoing tensions and fragmentation, particularly highlighted by the debate over the new electoral model.

Forced Displacement: Conflict, insecurity, and climate shocks continue to cause massive internal displacement, profoundly impacting social structures and livelihoods.

Humanitarian Crisis: A severe humanitarian crisis persists, with widespread food insecurity, malnutrition, and limited access to basic services.

Vulnerable Groups: Minority groups, despite consensus on their existence, often lack clarity on their inclusion and face challenges in full accommodation in crucial national decision-making processes.

Philosophy

State Building and Resilience: The overarching philosophy guiding Somalia's development is state-building and fostering resilience in the face of protracted conflict, political instability, and humanitarian crises. This includes strengthening institutions, promoting economic self-sufficiency, and improving security.

Balancing Tradition and Modernity: The debate over the electoral model (clan-based vs. one-person, one-vote) reflects a fundamental philosophical tension between traditional societal structures and aspirations for a modern, democratic state.

Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity: The government's strong stance against the Ethiopia-Somaliland MoU underscores a core commitment to national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

History

Colonial Era: Somalia was divided into British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland during the colonial period.

Independence and Union (1960): Gained independence in 1960 and united to form the Somali Republic.

Civil War (1991-Present): The overthrow of Siad Barre's military regime in 1991 plunged the country into a protracted civil war, characterized by clan-based conflicts, warlordism, and the rise of Islamist insurgencies like Al-Shabaab.

Transitional Governments and Federalism: Since the early 2000s, there have been various attempts to establish stable central governments and implement a federal system, with varying degrees of success and ongoing challenges in consolidating authority and achieving lasting peace. The current period in 2025 is a critical juncture in this long and complex process.

Social Work

Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Response: Social workers are critical in responding to the ongoing humanitarian crisis, including managing displacement, providing emergency relief, and addressing the impacts of recurrent climate shocks (droughts and floods).

Child Protection: Addressing child malnutrition, child marriage, and the recruitment of child soldiers by armed groups are key areas of intervention.

Gender-Based Violence: Social work plays a vital role in supporting survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, a pervasive issue in the conflict-affected environment.

Community Healing and Reconciliation: Given the legacy of conflict and clan divisions, social workers are involved in peacebuilding, reconciliation, and fostering social cohesion at the community level.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Extremely Restricted Environment: Somalia remains one of the most dangerous countries for journalists. Al-Shabaab actively targets and intimidates media workers, and security officials also restrict, beat, arrest, and detain journalists with impunity.


Censorship and Self-Censorship: This creates an environment of fear and self-censorship, severely limiting freedom of expression and public access to independent information.

Digitalization Initiatives: Despite the challenges, there are government efforts to improve data governance and potentially expand digitalization, which could eventually impact media and communication, although the current priority is control over information.

Education / Teaching

Limited Access and Quality: Access to quality education remains a significant challenge, particularly for children in rural areas, children with disabilities, and those displaced by conflict. The cost of secondary education is a major barrier.

Teacher Shortages: There is a critical shortage of qualified teachers, impacting the quality of education.

Youth Vulnerability: The lack of educational opportunities contributes to youth unemployment and vulnerability to recruitment by armed groups.

Human Capital Development: The government's commitment to "Human Capital Development" underscores the recognition of education's long-term importance for national stability and growth.

Library Science

Preservation of Cultural Heritage: In a country that has experienced prolonged conflict, libraries and archives are crucial for preserving Somalia's rich oral traditions, historical documents, and cultural heritage, much of which has been lost or is at risk.

Access to Information: They serve as vital centers for providing access to educational materials and information, particularly in areas where other educational infrastructure is limited.

Supporting Literacy and Peacebuilding: Libraries can play a role in promoting literacy and facilitating access to information that supports peacebuilding and reconciliation efforts. However, their development and accessibility are severely hampered by ongoing conflict and limited resources.
