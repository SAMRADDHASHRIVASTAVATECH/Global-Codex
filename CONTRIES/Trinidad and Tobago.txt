This is the first bilateral visit at the Prime Ministerial level to T&T since 1999 and aims to strengthen cooperation in finance, foreign policy, justice, education, legal affairs, health, agriculture, trade, energy, culture, sports, and ICT.

This visit underscores India's focus on strengthening relationships with the Global South.

Economic Outlook

Moderate Growth Driven by Energy (2025): Trinidad and Tobago's economy is expected to see moderate growth in 2025, largely driven by the energy sector. The World Bank projects GDP growth to rise to 2.8% in 2025, driven by increases in oil production. The IMF forecasts real GDP growth at 2.4% for 2025. Two new natural gas projects are anticipated to become operational by 2027, further boosting the energy sector.

Inflation and Fiscal Position: The IMF projects an average consumer price inflation rate of 1.3% for 2025. The general government net lending/borrowing is forecast at -3.4% of GDP, with gross debt at 67.8% of GDP.

Energy Sector Reforms: The Energy Chamber of Trinidad and Tobago welcomed recent comments by Energy Minister Dr. Roodal Moonilal regarding the "ease of doing business" in the energy sector. The Chamber advocates for fiscal regime reform, boosting oil and gas production, and improving the approvals process. A 2020 study commissioned by the Chamber highlighted that reducing the time between bid rounds and first gas by one year could significantly increase the net present value of a shallow-water offshore gas field by approximately US$120 million.

Economic Diversification Efforts: While the energy sector remains dominant, employing only 2.0% of the workforce but accounting for over one-third of GDP and two-thirds of exports, there's a recognized need to diversify the economic base. The government continues to focus on human capital development and building a knowledge-based economy.

Labour Market: The unemployment rate is projected at 4.1% for 2025. While overall job vacancies might be lower than the previous year, there has been a pickup in job opportunities, particularly in the public sector, hotels, restaurants, and business services.

Public Administration

Land Management and OJT Overhaul: The new government is engaging in discussions to improve land management processes and is set to overhaul the On-the-Job Training (OJT) program to improve trainee placements, indicating a focus on administrative efficiency and human resource development.

Ease of Doing Business: The Ministry of Energy is scheduled to host a symposium on the ease of doing business in the energy sector, signalling a proactive approach to streamline regulatory processes and attract investment.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Constitutional Protections and Gaps: Human rights in Trinidad and Tobago are protected by its Constitution, which includes rights like freedom of the press, religion, and non-discrimination based on sex. However, there are ongoing concerns, including the absence of explicit constitutional protection for the right to life and freedom from torture. Sodomy remains illegal, although prosecutions are rare.

National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security (March 2025): Trinidad and Tobago made history as the first Caribbean nation to launch a National Action Plan (NAP) on Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) (2025â€“2030). This plan focuses on tackling gun and gang-related violence by integrating women's perspectives into peacebuilding strategies, recognizing the gendered impact of violence. It outlines coordinated efforts across government, law enforcement, and civil society, with a focus on prevention and addressing root causes.

Human Rights and Gender Mainstreaming in Crime Investigations (February 2025): The UNODC, through its CRIMJUST initiative, conducted a workshop in February 2025 to strengthen human rights and gender mainstreaming in organized crime investigations. This initiative aims to ensure ethical and effective responses to organized crime by integrating human rights and gender perspectives into criminal justice responses.

Crime Rate Concerns: While specific 2025 crime rates are not available, crime remains a significant concern. The WPS NAP directly addresses gun and gang-related violence, indicating this as a priority. The government's approach includes treating crime and violence as public health issues, aiming for prevention through sustainable livelihoods for young people.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Religious Diversity and Harmony: Trinidad and Tobago is known for its rich religious diversity, with significant populations of Christians (various denominations), Hindus, and Muslims. The Constitution protects freedom of religion, and government officials regularly emphasize religious tolerance and harmony. This cultural mosaic is often highlighted, as seen by the Indian Prime Minister's visit commemorating 180 years of Indian immigration.

Gender Studies

WPS NAP (2025-2030): The launch of the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security is a major step for gender studies in Trinidad and Tobago. It aims to integrate women's perspectives, skills, and experiences into security strategies, addressing the impact of armed violence, organized crime, and gender-based violence. This plan recognizes that gender norms and inequalities shape how violence is experienced and perpetrated.

Labour Force Participation and Wage Gaps: Despite constitutional prohibitions against sex-based discrimination, gender disparities persist in the labor force, with women's participation lagging that of men and women earning, on average, 66% of men's wages for similar work.

Violence Against Women: Violence against women remains a significant issue, with many incidents reportedly going unreported due to perceived insensitivity of police and cultural acceptance of gender-based violence.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Melting Pot of Cultures: Trinidad and Tobago is a vibrant "melting pot" of cultures, influenced by its Indigenous, African, Indian, European, Middle Eastern, and Chinese heritage. This is particularly evident in its cuisine, music (steelpan, calypso, soca), and festivals (Carnival).

Indian Diaspora (180th Anniversary): July 2025 marks the 180th anniversary of the arrival of Indian immigrants to Trinidad and Tobago, a significant cultural milestone that is being commemorated during the Indian Prime Minister's visit. The Indian diaspora constitutes a large portion of the population (40-45%).

Social Challenges: Despite the rich cultural tapestry, challenges like crime, particularly gun and gang-related violence, impact social cohesion. The WPS NAP aims to address these issues through community engagement and by recognizing the public health dimension of violence.

Philosophy

Democracy and Inclusivity: The recent general election and the new government highlight ongoing efforts to strengthen democratic processes. The launch of the WPS NAP reflects a philosophical shift towards more inclusive and gender-transformative approaches to security and peacebuilding, emphasizing that peace and security must reflect the lived realities of all citizens.

Development and Diversification: The philosophical challenge for Trinidad and Tobago remains balancing its reliance on the energy sector with the need for sustainable economic diversification and human capital development for long-term prosperity.

Social Justice: Addressing issues like crime, gender-based violence, and economic disparities points to an ongoing societal pursuit of social justice and equitable opportunities for all citizens.

History

Colonial History: Trinidad and Tobago was colonized by various European powers, including Spain, France, and finally Britain, gaining independence in 1962.

Indentured Labor: Post-emancipation, the country saw significant immigration of indentured laborers from India, China, and Portugal, which profoundly shaped its demographic and cultural landscape.

Oil and Gas Economy: The discovery of oil and gas transformed the economy into an energy-dependent one, a defining feature of its modern history.

Political Development: Since independence, Trinidad and Tobago has maintained a democratic system, though it has experienced political shifts and challenges, including periods of social unrest. The 2025 general election is the latest chapter in its democratic evolution.

Indian Immigration Anniversary: The commemoration of 180 years of Indian immigration in 2025 highlights a crucial aspect of its social and cultural history.

Social Work

Addressing Violence and Trauma: Social workers are critical in addressing the widespread issue of gun and gang violence, providing support to victims and families. The WPS NAP provides a framework for multi-faceted interventions.

Community-Based Interventions: The focus on treating crime as a public health issue and empowering young people with sustainable livelihoods provides avenues for community-based social work, focusing on prevention and early intervention.

Gender-Based Violence Support: Social workers are key in providing support for survivors of gender-based violence, working with NGOs and government agencies to ensure access to services and advocate for policy change.

Youth Development: Overhauling the OJT program and providing sustainable livelihood means for young people aligns with social work principles of empowering vulnerable populations and fostering economic inclusion.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Digital Transformation Impact: The government's efforts in digital transformation (e.g., e-government portal) will change how information is disseminated and accessed by citizens, creating new opportunities and challenges for digital media and public relations.

Freedom of the Press: While the Constitution protects freedom of the press, there have been past reports of attempts to influence the media and "smear campaigns" against journalists, indicating ongoing vigilance is needed to protect media independence.

Access to Information and Literacy: They serve as crucial centers for promoting literacy, providing public access to information, and supporting educational initiatives across various demographics.

Supporting Digital Literacy: As the country moves towards digital transformation, libraries can play an important role in bridging the digital divide by offering digital literacy programs and access to online resources, ensuring that all citizens can participate in the digital economy.
