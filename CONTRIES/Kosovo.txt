Post-Election Political Inertia (July 2025): Kosovo held parliamentary elections on February 9, 2025, which saw the governing VetÃ«vendosje (VV) party, led by Prime Minister Albin Kurti, win the most votes (42.30% and 48 seats) but fall short of a majority in the 120-seat Assembly. This has led to a political stalemate, with an inability to elect a speaker and form a new government despite numerous attempts.

Government Formation Challenges: Prime Minister Kurti's choice for speaker, Albulena Haxhiu, has been rejected by opposition parties (Democratic Party of Kosovo - PDK with 24 seats, and Democratic League of Kosovo - LDK with 20 seats), leading to an institutional crisis. The LDK has proposed a transitional government of all ethnic Albanian parties, which VV has rejected.

Serb Minority Representation: The Assembly includes 20 reserved seats for minority communities, with 10 for the Serbian community. Local elections are scheduled for October 2025, which are particularly significant for Serbs in northern Kosovo, potentially enabling their return to local self-government institutions.

Dialogue with Serbia: The dialogue with Serbia for the comprehensive normalization of relations, centered on mutual recognition, has stalled. Despite a 2023 agreement (Ohrid Agreement), it remains unsigned and unimplemented. Progress on the Association of Serb Municipalities (ASM) is a key demand from the EU, but the Kosovar government is reluctant.

International Recognition and Integration: Kosovo continues to seek full international recognition and integration into international organizations. It has been recognized by 116 UN member states, with recent recognitions from Kenya and Sudan. Kosovo has a visa liberalization regime with the EU since January 1, 2024, and formally applied for EU membership in December 2022, though EU candidate status faces obstacles due to non-recognizing EU states. NATO membership is also a priority.

Economic Outlook

Robust Growth, but Challenges Ahead (July 2025): Kosovo's economy maintained strong growth in 2024 (4.4%) and is expected to continue growing at around 3.9-4% in 2025, driven by domestic consumption and investment. Inflation accelerated to 3.6% in May 2025.

Government Formation Impact: The prolonged delay in forming a new government is affecting investor confidence and slowing the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), despite a 4% year-on-year increase in Q1 2025.

Fiscal Concerns: The absence of a fully operational administration is reflected in a widening fiscal gap, with government expenditure surging while revenue growth is sluggish. The fiscal deficit is projected to be around 1.1-2.1% of GDP in 2025.

Unemployment and Demographics: The unemployment rate is hovering near 11%, disproportionately affecting young people and women. Remittances from the diaspora remain a crucial support for household incomes (up 4% in the first four months of 2025).

Trade Imbalances: Trade imbalances worsened in Q1 2025, with goods exports declining and imports surging, leading to a higher current account deficit. Services exports, however, continue to support growth.

IMF and EBRD Support: Kosovo has successfully implemented Stand-By and Resilience and Sustainability Facility Arrangements with the IMF, and the EBRD notes progress on fiscal reforms and public investment management.

Public Administration

Post-Election Impasse: Public administration is currently hampered by the political deadlock following the February 2025 elections, making it difficult to establish a fully functioning government and implement reforms.

EU Growth Plan: Kosovo's reform agenda, approved by the European Commission in October 2024, aims to unlock funds from the EU Growth Plan for the Western Balkans. However, Kosovo still needs to meet procedural requirements (ratification of agreements) to receive pre-financing, unlike other Western Balkan countries that have already received funds.

Strengthening Public Investment Management: Efforts continue to strengthen public investment management, with recent assessments highlighting improvements in budgeting practices for projects.

Fiscal Reforms: Key priorities for 2025 include fiscal reforms to strengthen the revenue base by closing loopholes and reducing exemptions, and improving financial oversight of publicly owned enterprises.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Human Rights Concerns: While domestic politics are seen as democratic and competitive, concerns regarding human rights, particularly those of the Serb minority, persist. The unilateral actions of the Kosovar government in northern municipalities have been criticized by the EU and US.

Rule of Law: Prime Minister Kurti claims credit for restoring the rule of law and pushing out criminal networks, which remains a key area of focus for international partners.

Judiciary Challenges: There are reports of a "rogue faction" within the judiciary working in coordination with foreign actors to spread fabricated allegations against the Prime Minister and his allies, suggesting potential challenges to judicial independence.

EULEX Mission: The EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) continues to operate, providing external oversight and support for rule of law institutions.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Predominantly Muslim: Kosovo is predominantly Muslim, with a significant adherence to Sunni Islam.

Religious Minorities: There is a notable Christian minority, primarily Serbian Orthodox, and smaller numbers of other religious groups.

Religious Freedom: Religious freedom is generally respected, though inter-ethnic and inter-religious tensions can be exacerbated by political issues, particularly between the Albanian majority and Serb minority.

Cultural Significance of Religious Sites: Kosovo holds numerous significant religious sites for both Islam and Orthodox Christianity, which are central to the cultural and historical identity of their respective communities.

Gender Studies

Unemployment Disparity: Unemployment disproportionately affects women in Kosovo, highlighting existing gender inequalities in the labor market.

Limited Female Labor Force Participation: Female labor force participation is constrained by factors such as a lack of childcare services, a barrier that policies aim to address to boost economic growth and enhance children's school readiness.

Political Representation: While there have been some gains in political representation, challenges likely remain in achieving full gender parity in leadership positions across all sectors.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Youngest Population in Europe: Kosovo boasts the youngest population in Europe, presenting both opportunities and challenges for social development.

Ethnic Diversity and Tensions: The population is predominantly Albanian, with significant Serb, Bosniak, Turkish, Ashkali, Egyptian, Gorani, and Roma minorities. Relations between Albanian and Serbian communities, particularly in the North, remain a central societal and political issue.

Cultural Identity: Kosovo has a vibrant and evolving cultural identity, drawing from its unique history and diverse influences.

Social Cohesion: Efforts to foster social cohesion and inter-ethnic understanding are ongoing, particularly given the historical tensions and divisions.

Philosophy

Self-Determination and Sovereignty: The core philosophical underpinning of Kosovo's governance is its assertion of self-determination and sovereignty, declared in 2008 and affirmed by the ICJ.

Democratic Values: Despite political fragmentation, Kosovar politics remain democratic and competitive, emphasizing values such as rule of law, political rights, and civil liberties, where it ranks high in improvements globally.

European Integration as a Guiding Principle: The aspiration for EU integration serves as a significant philosophical and strategic guide for domestic reforms and foreign policy.

History

Post-Yugoslavia (1990s): Kosovo was a federal unit of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and experienced significant conflict in the late 1990s, culminating in the 1999 NATO intervention.

Declaration of Independence (2008): Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008. This declaration was ruled by the UN's highest judicial body not to violate any applicable rule of international law.

Recent Elections (February 2025): The February 9, 2025 parliamentary elections are the most recent significant political event, shaping the current governmental landscape.

Bilateral Dialogue with Serbia: The history of dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade, including the Ohrid Agreement, reflects ongoing efforts to normalize relations.

Social Work

Youth Unemployment: Social workers are actively involved in addressing the high rate of joblessness, particularly among young people and women, through various programs and support initiatives.

Community Development: Social work contributes to community development efforts, especially in areas with vulnerable populations or inter-ethnic tensions.

Support for Vulnerable Groups: Providing support for minority communities and other vulnerable groups remains a key area of social work practice in Kosovo.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Democratic and Competitive Media: Kosovo generally enjoys a free and competitive media environment.

Challenges of Disinformation: Like many countries in the region, Kosovo faces challenges from disinformation campaigns, particularly concerning its political stability and relations with Serbia.

Importance of Credible Media: The need for a responsible and credible opposition and media is highlighted as essential for a well-functioning democracy, ensuring government accountability.

Education / Teaching

Focus on Skills Development: Efforts in education are likely geared towards improving the quality of education and skills of workers, especially those with lower education levels, to boost competitiveness.

Addressing Outmigration: Given population decline partly due to outmigration, education strategies may focus on retaining talent and equipping the workforce with skills relevant to the domestic economy.

Early Childhood Education: Expanding childcare services is seen as beneficial for improving labor market opportunities for women and enhancing children's school readiness through better early childhood education.

Library Science

Preservation of Cultural Heritage: Libraries play a crucial role in preserving Kosovo's cultural and historical heritage, including manuscripts and documents reflecting its diverse past.

Access to Information: Ensuring broad access to information and educational resources through libraries is vital for a developing nation.

Digitalization Efforts: Modern library science principles likely involve ongoing digitalization efforts to make collections more accessible and to safeguard materials.
