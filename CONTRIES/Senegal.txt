New Leadership and "System Change": As of July 2025, Senegal is navigating a new political era under President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who assumed office on April 2, 2024. His victory, along with the appointment of Ousmane Sonko as Prime Minister, signaled a desire for "system change" among the electorate, driven by promises to tackle corruption, poor governance, and to ensure a more equitable distribution of natural resource revenues. The previous government of Macky Sall had lost its absolute majority in the 2022 parliamentary elections, indicating a shift in public sentiment.


Political Context and Upcoming Elections: While the 2024 presidential election was deemed free and fair by international observers, it followed a period of significant political tension and protests, triggered by legal proceedings against then-opposition leader Ousmane Sonko. Although President Faye's initial budget proposal for 2025 was rejected, leading to a snap election called for August 29, 2025, Senegal remains a relatively stable democracy. This upcoming election will be a key test for the new ruling party, the Samoa Uniting Party (SUP), and its ability to govern.

Strategic Leadership for Sovereignty and Transformation: President Faye's government is pursuing a "pan-African course" with a strong emphasis on national sovereignty, moving away from perceived French political, military, and economic dominance. The "Senegal 2050" plan, implemented in October 2024, aims for 6.5% annual growth and to triple GDP per capita by 2050, focusing on national sovereignty, food sovereignty, and economic transformation. This includes significant investment in agriculture, energy, and digital transformation.



Foreign Policy:

Reassessing Western Ties: The new leadership has announced a reassessment of Senegal's relations with Western nations, particularly France. This includes the non-renewal of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement with the EU and the ordered withdrawal of French troops from Senegal, completed by the end of 2024.

Pan-Africanism and Regional Leadership: Senegal continues its active, stabilizing role within ECOWAS, the African Union, and the United Nations, acting as a mediator in regional conflicts and contributing to UN peace missions. President Faye has been actively engaging with other African leaders, including visiting Burkina Faso to meet President Ibrahim Traore and participating in the inauguration of Thomas Sankara's mausoleum.


Diaspora Engagement: A key focus is on leveraging the Senegalese diaspora for national development, promoting their skills and investments, and planning the first National Diaspora Day in December 2025.

New International Partnerships: Senegal is actively seeking "win-win partnerships" and international cooperation, as highlighted by the "Invest in Senegal" forum scheduled for October 7-8, 2025.

Economic Outlook

Fastest Growing Economy in Sub-Saharan Africa: Senegal is projected to be Sub-Saharan Africa's fastest-growing economy in 2025, with IMF data projecting an impressive 8.4% GDP expansion. Some forecasts even suggest it could reach 10% growth.

Hydrocarbon Production as a Game Changer: This surge in growth is primarily driven by the launch of oil and gas production from the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) and Sangomar fields, which are expected to significantly improve export revenues, reduce import reliance, and generate substantial long-term financial gains.

Fiscal Challenges and Reforms: Despite the positive growth outlook, Senegal faces significant fiscal challenges, including a deteriorated current account deficit and a higher-than-reported budget deficit and debt from the previous administration. The World Bank has approved $115 million in financing to support Senegal's fiscal reforms, including public debt sustainability, public financial management, and domestic resource mobilization. The government has committed to fiscal consolidation, improved governance, and a gradual reduction of energy subsidies.



Diversification and Investment: Beyond hydrocarbons, the government is committed to economic diversification, promoting agriculture (aiming for food sovereignty), and attracting investment in various sectors. The 2025 Finance Bill includes significant investments in agricultural productivity, value chains, local processing industries, and support for SMEs.

Inflation: Inflation is expected to remain contained, projected around 2.0% for 2025.

Public Administration

Governance Reforms and Anti-Corruption: A key pillar of the new government's agenda is rebuilding institutions and actively fighting corruption, ensuring that development resources are used efficiently and equitably. The Prime Minister has highlighted alarming findings from contract reviews, emphasizing the importance of public procurement.


Digital Transformation: The "Digital Senegal 2025" strategy aims to digitize public services and make digitalization a central lever for improving administration, making it more transparent and user-oriented. This includes the rollout of a modern financial management system and expanded use of electronic procurement tools, as supported by the World Bank.


Decentralization and Citizen Engagement: There's an emphasis on improving the functioning of the public service, including responding to Ombudsman recommendations and strengthening oversight at regional and local levels. The President has called for inclusive participation in a national dialogue on the political system.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Civil Law System: Senegal operates under a civil law legal system, influenced by the French model.

Human Rights Context (Post-Sall Era): While the previous government faced criticism for restrictions on freedom of speech, assembly, and arbitrary detentions, the new government, born from a political amnesty for political prisoners, is under scrutiny to uphold human rights more robustly.

Freedom of Expression and Assembly: The period leading up to the 2024 elections saw significant protests. The commitment to a "national dialogue" on the political system, involving various stakeholders including civil society and youth organizations, indicates a potential opening for greater public participation.


Casamance Conflict: The long-standing conflict in the Casamance region has seen recent peace agreements, and the new government has strong political support in the region, raising hopes for lasting peace.

Environmental Justice: Senegal has ratified several human rights and environmental treaties, and its criminal law has limited extra-territorial jurisdiction for international crimes and acts of terrorism.

Death Penalty: Abolished.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Predominantly Muslim: Senegal is a predominantly Muslim country, with Sufi brotherhoods (Tijaniyyah, Muridiyyah, Qadiriyyah, Layene) playing a significant role in social and political life.

Interreligious Harmony: The country is known for its strong tradition of interreligious dialogue and peaceful coexistence between Muslims and the Christian minority. The President has praised this "exemplary interreligious dialogue" and pledged to support the modernization of religious sites.


Influence of Religious Leaders: Religious leaders often hold considerable moral and social authority.

Gender Studies

Focus on Empowerment: The World Food Programme's 2025-2029 country strategic plan for Senegal emphasizes gender equality and women's economic empowerment as key drivers of improved social indicators, including through financial inclusion.

Challenges: While legal frameworks exist, women often face barriers to accessing financial products and services, leading many to rely on informal mechanisms. Ongoing efforts are needed to address these disparities and ensure full gender equality across all sectors.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Wolof Dominance and Diverse Ethnicities: The Wolof are the largest ethnic group, and their language and culture are widely influential. However, Senegal is home to a diverse array of other ethnic groups (e.g., Fula, Serer, Jola, Mandinka), each with their own rich cultural traditions.


"Teranga" (Hospitality): A core cultural value is "Teranga," embodying deep-seated traditions of hospitality, generosity, and respect.

Youth Engagement: The government is actively promoting youth involvement in agricultural development and food sovereignty, recognizing their crucial role in the nation's future.

Diaspora's Role: The significant Senegalese diaspora plays a vital role in remittances and cultural exchange, with increasing efforts to integrate them into national development plans.

Philosophy

Sovereignty and Self-Reliance: The new government's philosophy is strongly anchored in national sovereignty, aiming to reduce dependence on former colonial powers and assert more control over national resources and development trajectory. This is evident in the "Senegal 2050" plan.

Ethical Governance: The emphasis on "ethics" and fighting corruption by the new leadership signifies a philosophical commitment to good governance and public accountability.

Pan-Africanism: President Faye and Prime Minister Sonko's pan-Africanist stance reflects a philosophy of solidarity and cooperation with other African nations, aiming for collective development and self-determination on the continent.

Long-Standing Democracy: Known for its relatively stable democratic tradition compared to many other West African nations, with peaceful transitions of power since its independence.

Post-2000 Era: The early 2000s saw the end of the long rule of the Socialist Party, followed by a period of sustained economic growth under President Abdoulaye Wade, then Macky Sall's presidency (2012-2024) which saw significant infrastructure development and economic plans (Plan Sénégal Emergent), but also increasing political tensions and restrictions on dissent. The 2024 election marked a pivotal moment, ushering in a new political generation.

Youth and Women Empowerment: Supporting vulnerable youth and empowering women, especially in economic activities, remains a priority for social development.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Shift in Media Environment: The new government's ascent, which followed a period of media restrictions under the previous administration, brings a renewed focus on press freedom. While challenges may remain, the initial rhetoric has been in favor of greater transparency.
