San Marino
Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Unitary Parliamentary Representative Democratic Republic: San Marino operates as a unitary parliamentary representative democratic republic. Its unique political system involves two Captains Regent who serve as co-heads of state and government, elected by the Grand and General Council every six months. This system, rooted in Roman Republic traditions, emphasizes collegiality and mutual control. The Grand and General Council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members, elected every five years by proportional representation. The current Secretary of State for Foreign and Political Affairs, Luca Beccari, functions similarly to a Prime Minister.

Political Stability and Coalition Government: Despite being a multi-party system, it's often difficult for any single party to gain a pure majority, leading to the formation of coalition governments. This typically ensures political stability and continuity of economic policies. The Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party (PDCS) and the Party of Socialists and Democrats (PSD) are among the main political forces.

Strategic Leadership and Sustainable Growth: San Marino's strategic leadership is focused on fostering a new, more sustainable growth model. This is driven by its manufacturing sector and non-financial services, especially tourism. The government aims to capitalize on its niche market and political stability to ensure economic resilience amidst global uncertainties.

Foreign Policy:

Close Ties with Italy and European Integration: San Marino is an enclave completely surrounded by Italy, leading to extremely close historical, political, social, and economic ties. It uses the Euro as its official currency through a monetary agreement with the EU and has a customs union with the EU since 1991.

Association Agreement with the EU: A significant development in 2025 is the ongoing progress towards a comprehensive Association Agreement with the European Union. Negotiations with Andorra and San Marino concluded in December 2023, and the European Commission formally proposed approval in April 2024. This agreement aims to provide greater integration and access to the EU market, moving beyond the current "fragmented" collection of specific agreements. This demonstrates San Marino's commitment to enhancing its relationship with Europe without full EU membership.

Active Multilateralism: Despite its small size, San Marino maintains an extensive diplomatic network and is an active member of various international organizations, including the UN, Council of Europe, and UNICEF. It has a robust human rights reporting schedule with the UN, with its record being reviewed by the UN women's rights committee and the Universal Periodic Review in 2025.

Economic Outlook

Resilient Growth: San Marino's economy is expected to remain resilient in 2025. Real GDP growth is projected at 1.0% (IMF, May 2025 Budget at a Glance) and nominal GDP at $2.840 billion (2025). This growth is primarily led by the manufacturing sector and non-financial services, including a thriving tourism industry that has already exceeded pre-pandemic levels, with over 2 million visitors in 2024.

Key Sectors: Tourism, banking, and manufacturing (ceramics, clothing, furniture, paints, etc.) form the backbone of the economy. The sale of collectible postage stamps also contributes.

Fiscal Health: Public debt is projected to decrease to 61.3% of GDP in 2025 (IMF), indicating sound fiscal management. The current account balance is projected at a surplus of 4.0% of GDP, further demonstrating economic health.

Inflation and Unemployment: Inflation is projected at 2.0% for 2025, with a stable unemployment rate forecasted at 4.4%.

Banking System Improvements: Significant progress has been made in resolving issues within the banking system, with reduced Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) and increased liquidity, restoring confidence among savers. The Association Agreement with the EU is expected to further boost the banking sector by providing greater market integration.
