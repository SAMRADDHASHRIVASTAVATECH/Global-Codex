Stable Parliamentary Democracy: As of July 2025, Slovenia maintains a stable parliamentary democratic system. The current government is led by the Freedom Movement (Gibanje Svoboda), which secured 41 seats in the last parliamentary election. The Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) is the largest opposition party with 27 seats. While there's a multi-party system, the political landscape is generally stable, contrasting with some of its more turbulent neighbors.

Strategic Leadership: Climate Neutrality and Resilience: Slovenia's strategic leadership is heavily focused on environmental sustainability and climate action. The government adopted a proposed Climate Act in June 2025, which aims to establish a strategic climate policy management framework beyond narrow environmental concerns. This Act is a key document for the coming decade, designed to ensure long-term security, quality of life, and sustainable economic development while adapting to climate challenges. It includes an integrated approach to adaptation from national to regional levels, with an emphasis on protecting vulnerable groups and ensuring a fair transition. This is part of a broader commitment to becoming a model of sustainable development and a smart transition to climate neutrality.

Defence and Security Policy: Slovenia is committed to strengthening its broad societal security, increasing resilience, and enhancing defence capabilities. The government plans to significantly increase defence spending, aiming to allocate 2% of GDP in 2025, rising to 3% by 2030. This new policy views security comprehensively, encompassing military and civilian aspects, including critical infrastructure protection, energy security, cybersecurity, and information resilience.

Foreign Policy:

Strong EU and NATO Commitment: Slovenia remains a committed member of the European Union (EU) and NATO. It actively participates in EU economic policy coordination (European Semester) and is implementing its national recovery and resilience plan, aligned with EU objectives for innovation, decarbonization, and security. Slovenia also fully adheres to NATO's collective defense principles, recently agreeing to a new 5% defence spending target at the June 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague.

Active Multilateralism: Slovenia engages actively in multilateral diplomacy. For instance, in June 2025, it noted the planned signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the State of Palestine, demonstrating its commitment to international peace efforts and the two-state solution in the Middle East.

Fiscal Position: Slovenia has made efforts to improve its fiscal position. The fiscal deficit narrowed to 0.9% of GDP in 2024 (from 2.6% in 2023), significantly below the OECD average. Public debt is also well-managed, with a target to keep it below 60% of GDP. The government's medium-term fiscal-structural plan for 2025-2028 aims for further fiscal adjustment.

The country scored below the OECD average on the Digital Government Index in 2022 but performed strongly in "Government as a Platform."

Fiscal and Procurement Reforms: The government conducts periodic spending reviews to manage expenditures and improve effectiveness. It also incorporates environmental objectives and quantitative targets into its public procurement policies (green public procurement).

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

However, it also has recognized Hungarian and Italian minorities who have special representation in the National Assembly. There are also other ethnic communities, particularly from former Yugoslav republics.

High Quality of Life: Slovenia ranks highly on global composite indicators of quality of life, and perceived life satisfaction is consistently among the best in the EU.

Aging Population: A significant demographic challenge is the aging population, with the share of people aged 65+ expected to rise from 20% to 30% over the next 25 years. This affects the pension system and the labor market, which already sees low employment among older adults and delayed workforce entry by young people.
