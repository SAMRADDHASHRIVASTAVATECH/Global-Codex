National People's Power (NPP) Government and Local Election Outcome (May 2025): As of July 2025, Sri Lanka is governed by the National People's Power (NPP) coalition, led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The May 2025 local government elections, delayed for three years due to the 2022 economic crisis, served as a significant test for the six-month-old NPP government. While the NPP emerged as the largest party, winning 266 out of 339 local councils and securing 43.26% of the vote, this represents a notable decline from the 61% it received in the November 2024 parliamentary elections. The NPP secured outright majorities in only about half of the councils it won, leading to controversial deals with "undesirable elements" and opposition parties to gain control of local bodies. This has drawn criticism from those who view it as a departure from the NPP's anti-establishment promises.

Political Fragmentation and Opposition: The election results highlight a fragmented political landscape at the local level. Traditional Tamil parties, such as ITAK and ACTC, saw an increase in their vote share in the North and East, indicating a shift in support. Opposition parties, including the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), and United National Party (UNP), are attempting to regain lost popular support and form alliances to challenge the NPP's dominance at the local level.

Pressure to Deliver and Accountability: The NPP government faces immense pressure to deliver on key promises made over the last six months, particularly concerning economic relief (addressing high cost of living and poverty) and accountability for national issues, including the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks and broader rule of law concerns.

Foreign Policy and Debt Restructuring: Sri Lanka continues to navigate complex international relations, especially concerning its debt restructuring efforts. While substantial progress has been made with the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and bilateral creditors (e.g., China), and 98% of Eurobonds have been exchanged, long-term debt sustainability remains a critical concern, particularly as foreign debt repayments are expected to increase from 2028. The country is also exploring diplomatic avenues to negotiate more favourable trade terms with the U.S. following the imposition of a 44% reciprocal tariff on Sri Lankan exports, especially affecting the garment industry. India-Sri Lanka relations are noted as particularly strong.

Economic Outlook

Modest Recovery Amidst Challenges: Sri Lanka's economy showed a remarkable recovery in 2024, with 5% growth, surpassing earlier projections. However, growth is expected to moderate to 3.5%-3.9% in 2025 due to "scarring effects" of the crisis, structural impediments, global headwinds, and unprecedented trade policy uncertainty (e.g., US tariffs).

Poverty and Cost of Living: Despite economic recovery, a significant portion of the population (an estimated 24.5% in 2024) remains in poverty or at risk of falling back into poverty. Household incomes, employment, and overall welfare are still below pre-crisis levels, and the cost of living remains a major public concern.

Fiscal and External Stability: The government has made progress in fiscal consolidation, achieving a primary surplus and reducing public debt, supported by higher VAT revenues and capital budget under-execution. Usable foreign reserves have rebuilt, leading to the removal of remaining import restrictions. Strong tourism revenues and remittances continue to support a current account surplus.

Export-Led Growth: Exports have shown robust growth in the first quarter of 2025 (nearly 6%), driven by both merchandise and services, with the technology and export-oriented manufacturing sectors showing strong performance and positive employee perception.

Inflation: Headline inflation, as measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index, has remained negative since September 2024 (reaching -4.2% in February 2025) due to energy price adjustments, currency appreciation, and subdued household demand. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has lowered its policy rate to 8%.

Brain Drain: The "brain drain" due to emigration of skilled professionals (doctors, lawyers, IT workers) seeking better prospects abroad continues to raise concerns about the country's long-term capacity to rebuild.

Energy Sector: The country is facing potential rises in electricity tariffs, impacting the general public. There are efforts to implement solar power initiatives, but feed-in tariffs for rooftop solar have been reduced.

Public Administration

Governance and Accountability: The NPP government is under pressure to improve governance and accountability, particularly regarding issues like the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks. Its recent "deal-making" with "undesirable elements" at the local level has raised concerns about a potential deviation from its promised "Clean" campaign and political culture shift.

Legal Reforms (Delayed/Controversial): While the government pledged to repeal the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and replace it with a new Anti-Terrorism Act, and introduce an Online Safety Act, these processes have been criticised for lack of transparency, adequate consultation, and for potentially stifling dissent. The Online Safety Act (OSA) was passed in January 2025 despite Supreme Court determination requiring 31 mandatory amendments, which were not incorporated. The Telecommunications Amendment Bill also passed with concerns about its potential to infringe freedom of expression.

Digitalisation: Initiatives like the selection of a digital ID vendor are part of the broader move towards digitalisation within public administration.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Common Law System: Sri Lanka's legal system is based on English common law, influenced by its colonial past.

Persistent Human Rights Issues: The criminal justice system continues to face significant challenges related to human rights.

Impunity for Past Crimes: Despite calls from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and international bodies, accountability for large-scale violations during the 1983-2009 civil war remains elusive. Successive governments have rejected international probes, and domestic mechanisms have largely failed to deliver justice. The UN Human Rights Chief Volker TÃ¼rk, who visited in June 2025, emphasized the "impunity trap" and the need for an international mechanism for victim confidence-building. The discovery of new mass graves in the North has reignited concerns.

Draconian Legislation and Dissent: The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) continues to be used, disproportionately against minorities and government critics, despite pledges to abolish it. New laws like the Online Safety Act are seen as potentially stifling freedom of expression and assembly.

Suppression of Dissent: There have been arrests of student protesters, disruption of protests, and continued legal action against "Aragalaya" protesters (from the 2022 economic crisis).

Harassment of Activists and Journalists: Journalists and civil society members, particularly those working on land rights, enforced disappearances, or with former combatants, face continued harassment and intimidation.

"Operation Yukthiya": The second phase of the anti-drug initiative "Operation Yukthiya" continues despite reports of human rights violations, including arbitrary arrests, torture, and denial of due process, predominantly affecting marginalised socio-economic groups.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Buddhist Majority, Religious Diversity: Sri Lanka is predominantly a Buddhist country, with Theravada Buddhism deeply intertwined with its culture and national identity.

Religious Minorities: Significant religious minorities include Hindus (primarily Tamils), Muslims, and Christians.

Religious Freedom Concerns: While generally tolerant, there have been concerns regarding the rights of religious minorities and instances of discrimination.

Gender Studies

Vulnerability of Women and Girls: Women and girls remain particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence (GBV), with a high incidence of sexual violence.

Legal Protections Lacking: Sri Lanka has not ratified key international conventions on women's rights, such as CEDAW or the Maputo Protocol, hindering legal protections. Proposed legislative amendments to ensure the rights of Muslim women and girls have not been carried out.

Empowerment Initiatives: Despite these challenges, efforts are being made to include women in peacebuilding and conflict resolution processes, including training for women in uniform to combat GBV. The government also presented a Gender Equality Bill in May 2025, though it was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and requires a two-thirds majority or a referendum for passage.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Ethnic Divisions and Reconciliation: Sri Lanka remains a multi-ethnic society, primarily composed of Sinhalese (majority), Tamils (minority), and Muslims. The legacy of the civil war (1983-2009) continues to shape ethnic relations. Reconciliation efforts have made limited progress, and deep-seated grievances persist, particularly among the Tamil community, who continue to demand justice for war crimes and abuses.

Displacement and Vulnerability: Internal displacement due to conflict and climate-related events remains a significant social issue, impacting livelihoods and increasing vulnerability.

Poverty and Social Impact of Crisis: The severe economic crisis has significantly worsened poverty, leading to declining real incomes, job losses, and households adopting "risky coping strategies," such as cutting human capital spending and reducing nutritious food intake. This has a profound social impact, straining the social contract between citizens and the state.

Public Dissatisfaction: The reduced mandate for the NPP in the May 2025 local elections, despite its strong parliamentary showing in 2024, indicates public dissatisfaction with the pace of economic relief and accountability.

Philosophy

Post-Crisis Resilience and Reform: A central philosophical theme for Sri Lanka in 2025 is navigating the path of post-crisis resilience and implementing structural reforms to avoid future economic collapses. This involves balancing austerity measures with social welfare and growth.

Justice and Accountability: The ongoing debate about accountability for past human rights abuses and war crimes reflects a profound philosophical struggle between national sovereignty and the universal principles of justice and human rights.

National Identity and Reconciliation: The country grapples with defining a unified national identity while acknowledging and addressing the historical grievances and aspirations of its diverse ethnic and religious communities.

Democracy vs. Authoritarian Tendencies: The passing of controversial laws and actions perceived as stifling dissent raise philosophical questions about the balance between state security and individual freedoms in a recovering democracy.

History

Ancient Kingdoms and Colonial Rule: A rich history of ancient kingdoms, followed by Portuguese, Dutch, and British colonial rule.

Independence (1948): Gained independence from Britain in 1948 as Ceylon, later becoming the Republic of Sri Lanka.

Civil War (1983-2009): A devastating civil war between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist group, which ended in 2009. The legacy of this conflict, including issues of accountability and reconciliation, profoundly shapes the present.

Post-War Reconciliation Challenges: Post-war efforts at reconciliation and political reform have been slow and controversial.

2022 Economic Crisis and "Aragalaya": The severe economic crisis in 2022 led to widespread public protests ("Aragalaya") and the ousting of the then-President, marking a significant turning point in recent history.

2024-2025 Political Shift: The 2024 elections and the formation of the NPP government, followed by the May 2025 local elections, represent a new chapter in Sri Lanka's political evolution, signaling a desire for change and new governance.

Social Work

Humanitarian Response: Social workers are crucial in responding to the ongoing humanitarian challenges, including food insecurity, malnutrition, and support for internally displaced persons and returnees.

Poverty Alleviation: Addressing the rising poverty levels and supporting households struggling with the high cost of living are key areas of intervention.

Trauma and Mental Health: Providing psychosocial support to individuals and communities affected by the long-standing civil war, violence, and recent economic crisis is a significant need.

Child Protection: Protecting vulnerable children from the impacts of poverty, violence, and lack of education remains a priority.

GBV Support: Social workers play a vital role in providing support and interventions for survivors of gender-based violence.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Challenging Environment for Media Freedom: Sri Lanka remains a challenging environment for media freedom. Journalists face continued harassment, intimidation, and restrictions, particularly when reporting on sensitive issues like security and human rights.

Controversial Legislation: The recently passed Online Safety Act and Telecommunications Amendment Bill are seen as tools that could be used to curb freedom of expression and suppress dissent, raising concerns among media watchdogs.

Disinformation: The political climate and ongoing human rights issues contribute to an environment where disinformation can thrive, making the role of independent and responsible journalism even more critical.

Education / Teaching

Access and Quality Issues: Access to quality education remains a challenge, particularly in rural and conflict-affected areas. The economic crisis has further strained household budgets, impacting children's ability to attend school and access learning materials.

Child Malnutrition: High rates of acute malnutrition among children are a concern, impacting their health and educational outcomes.

Human Capital Development: Despite the challenges, there is a recognized need to invest in human capital development through education to support long-term economic recovery and social stability.

Library Science

Preservation of Knowledge and Cultural Heritage: Libraries are essential for preserving Sri Lanka's rich and diverse cultural heritage, including its literature, history, and various languages.

Access to Information: In a country facing economic and social challenges, libraries provide crucial access to information, educational resources, and opportunities for self-learning.

Community Learning Spaces: Libraries can serve as important community learning spaces, fostering literacy and supporting educational initiatives, particularly in underserved areas. International library conferences in Sri Lanka in 2025 highlight the ongoing efforts to develop the library sector.
