1. Political Science / IR / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies
ðŸ”¹ Governance & Crisis Management
Transitional Presidential Council (TPC): Established April 2024 to lead Haiti to elections by February 2026. However, it suffers internal divisions, allegations of corruption, and lacks broad legitimacy.

Interim PM Changes: Garry Conille (removed late 2024); Alix Didier Fils-AimÃ© installed. Instability in leadership continues.

Election Feasibility: Nominally planned, but security vacuum and infrastructure collapse make them highly uncertain.

ðŸ”¹ Security and Foreign Engagement
Gang Control: Gangs control 85% of Port-au-Prince; governance and services nearly collapsed.

MSS Mission: Kenya-led Multinational Security Support (UN-approved), struggling due to underfunding, lack of equipment, and limited troops (well under 2,500 target).

UNSCR & Global Attention: Growing calls for full UN Peacekeeping Force, but no consensus reached yet.

ðŸ”¹ International Challenges
Arms Trafficking: Central enabler of gang dominance, tied to regional smuggling networks.

Deportations: US and Caribbean countries continue deporting Haitiansâ€”worsens humanitarian burden.

Economic Freefall: GDP growth at -4.0% in 2024, 1.0% projected in 2025, with inflation at 27.2%.

2. Public Administration
ðŸ”¹ Collapse of Institutions
State Non-Functional in major zones: Ministries, courts, schools, and services are inactive or inaccessible.

Revenue Collection: Virtually impossible in gang-held areas. IMF Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) offers conditional support for reforms, but security is prerequisite.

ðŸ”¹ Police and Security Forces
Haitian National Police (HNP): Understaffed, underpaid, poorly equipped. Facing assassinations and desertion.

3. Criminal Justice / Law / Legal Studies
ðŸ”¹ Legal System
Based on French civil law, but non-functional in practice due to insecurity and political paralysis.

ðŸ”¹ Human Rights Collapse
Violence (Q1 2025):

1,617 killed, 580 injured, 161 kidnapped.

Gangs use rape, murder, and torture for territorial control.

Sexual Violence: Systematic use of gang rape and sexual slavery, especially targeting displaced women and girls.

Child Soldiers: Sharp increase in child recruitment by gangs.

ðŸ”¹ Mob Justice ("Bwa KalÃ©")
Civilians taking up arms, leading to extrajudicial killings and death without trial.

ðŸ”¹ Accountability
No real capacity for prosecutions. Special judicial units exist in name only.

President MoÃ¯seâ€™s assassination case remains unresolved.

4. Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies
ðŸ”¹ Religious Landscape
Christianity (Catholic + Evangelical), Vodou integrated into social and spiritual life.

Religious Institutions: Often the last standing service providersâ€”delivering food, shelter, healing, and moral leadership.

ðŸ”¹ Faith-Based Advocacy
Churches and religious leaders frequently call for peace, unity, and international help.

5. Gender Studies
ðŸ”¹ Worsening Gender-Based Violence (GBV)
GBV as a Weapon: Rape used as control, especially in IDP camps.

Survivor Services: Practically nonexistentâ€”lack of clinics, safe spaces, and legal recourse.

Maternal Health: UNFPA appeals for SRH and GBV funding as maternal and neonatal risks skyrocket.

ðŸ”¹ Leadership Inclusion
Womenâ€™s rights groups part of TPC process, but not influential at the highest levels of decision-making.

6. Anthropology / Sociology / Ethnic Studies / Cultural Studies
ðŸ”¹ Social Breakdown
Communities disintegrating due to displacement and gang rule.

Informal economy becomes sole survival option in absence of functioning institutions.

ðŸ”¹ Resilience
Despite adversity, mutual aid, grassroots support, and spiritual resilience remain strong.

ðŸ”¹ Food Insecurity (2025)
5.7 million+ in acute food insecurity.

8,400+ people in catastrophic hunger (IPC Phase 5).

Children under 5 suffering emergency-level malnutrition.

7. Philosophy
ðŸ”¹ Historical Ethos
Founded on liberation philosophy: independence from slavery (1804) shaped a proud national identity.

ðŸ”¹ Current Crisis
Violates core philosophical values of dignity, justice, and sovereignty.

Calls for international solidarity are growing, but so are concerns of neocolonial intervention.

8. History
ðŸ”¹ Key Events
1804: Independence via slave rebellionâ€”first Black republic.

1915â€“1934: US Occupationâ€”legacy of resentment and underdevelopment.

1986: Fall of Duvalier dictatorship.

2010: Earthquake killed 230,000+, displacing over 1.5 million.

2021: President MoÃ¯se assassinatedâ€”triggered current collapse.

2024â€“2025: TPC installed, MSS deployed, but crisis deepens.

9. Social Work
ðŸ”¹ Key Priorities
Life-Saving Aid: Water, food, shelter, and medical support to over 5.7 million.

Psychosocial Trauma Care: For GBV survivors, displaced children, and war-traumatized populations.

IDP Management: ~1.3 million displaced, many in schools or roadside camps.

ðŸ”¹ Child Protection
Safe spaces, education continuity, and gang exit strategies are vital.

10. Journalism / Communication / Media
ðŸ”¹ Extreme Risk
Targeted killings, kidnappings, and censorship. Journalists often operate anonymously or flee.

ðŸ”¹ Misinformation Crisis
Gang-led disinformation, fake news, and political manipulation undermine public trust.

ðŸ”¹ International Advocacy
Global media and NGOs play a critical awareness role in keeping Haiti on the international agenda.

11. Education
ðŸ”¹ System Collapse
Schools closed, attacked, or used as shelters.

1.5+ million students and teachers in need of emergency education.

ðŸ”¹ Consequences
Lost generation: Education disruptions threaten human capital, social mobility, and future workforce.

Children at risk of gang recruitment and early pregnancy.

12. Library Science
ðŸ”¹ Critical Functions (Where Possible)
Libraries could serve as:

Safe havens for education continuity.

Sources for civic education, peacebuilding, and healing.

Preservers of cultural memory in a collapsing state.

13. Peace Studies / Human Rights
ðŸ”¹ Urgent Human Rights Crises
Mass killings, sexual slavery, starvation, child soldiers, and mass displacement.

ðŸ”¹ Priorities for Peacebuilding
Gang demobilization & DDR: Disarmament and reintegration are essential.

Restoration of justice: International support for special courts, mobile tribunals, or hybrid mechanisms.

Civilian protection: UN and regional actors must expand safe zones, aid corridors, and evacuation networks.

ðŸ”¹ Transitional Justice
Eventual mechanisms will need to address mass atrocities, gender-based crimes, and systemic impunity.
