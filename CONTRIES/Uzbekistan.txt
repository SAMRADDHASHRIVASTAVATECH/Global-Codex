Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Authoritarian with Reforms: Uzbekistan remains a presidential democracy in constitution, but the President, Shavkat Mirziyoyev (re-elected 2021), largely determines the political course. While ambitious reforms have been underway since 2016, aiming to increase administrative effectiveness, strengthen rule of law, and develop civil society, a parliamentary opposition is still absent, and all parties are considered government-aligned.

"Development Strategy for a New Uzbekistan 2022-2026": This program continues to guide the country's development, focusing on public sector modernization, private sector promotion, and improvements in health and social protection.

Foreign Policy of Neutrality: Uzbekistan maintains a foreign policy of neutrality and non-alliance. It is actively expanding Central Asian cooperation and increasing its involvement in regional and international organizations.

On July 1, 2025, Khiva hosted the First Uzbekistan-Azerbaijan Inter-Parliamentary Forum, aiming to deepen strategic partnership and elevate inter-parliamentary dialogue. This follows the ratification of an allied partnership treaty in May 2025.

Uzbekistan also participated in the EAEU Summit on June 27, 2025, as an observer state, emphasizing deepening economic cooperation with EAEU members.

Efforts continue to integrate Afghanistan into a cooperative economic framework, with projects like the Trans-Afghan Railway being developed with Russia and Uzbekistan.

Government Structure: Uzbekistan is a republic with a bicameral parliament. The Prime Minister is Abdulla Aripov (since 2016).

Economic Outlook

Strong Growth Momentum (July 2025): Uzbekistan's economy continues a robust growth trajectory, driven by structural reforms and strong domestic demand. Real GDP growth is projected around 5.9% to 6.7% for 2025.

Key Growth Drivers: The services sector is a main driver, along with strong activity in construction and industry. Foreign trade and investment are also significant contributors, with exports jumping significantly in early 2025. Remittances continue to support economic expansion.

Inflation and Monetary Policy: Inflation remains relatively high, projected at 8.1% to 9.8% for 2025, prompting the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) to maintain a moderate monetary policy. Energy tariff adjustments also contribute to inflationary pressures.

Fiscal Challenges and Reforms: The government budget has recorded substantial deficits in 2024, necessitating active fiscal consolidation measures for sustainability in 2025 (deficit projected to moderate to 3.4% of GDP). Efforts are being made to privatize state-owned enterprises and strengthen fiscal management.

Financial Sector Reforms: The Bank Resolution and Liquidation Law (approved April 2025) introduces new tools for crisis management, and a new deposit insurance law (February 2025) eliminates blanket guarantees and shortens payout periods.

WTO Alignment: Efforts are ongoing to align national legislation with World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, including abolishing exclusive rights and inefficient tax/customs benefits.

National Investment Fund: Established in August 2024, this fund manages state assets and aims to integrate OECD corporate governance and ESG principles.

Public Administration

"Year of Environmental Protection and the Green Economy" (2025): At President Mirziyoyev's initiative, 2025 is dedicated to environmental protection and the green economy. This includes initiatives for water conservation, promoting renewable energy (solar, wind), modernizing agriculture, and increasing environmental awareness. The "Green Space" program involves large-scale tree planting.

Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): The IMF released a paper in June 2025 highlighting Uzbekistan's experience with PPPs, emphasizing their potential for improving public investment while also noting associated risks and management strategies.

Welfare System Overhaul: Plans announced in February 2025 aim to further restructure the welfare system and introduce new economic support policies for low-income households, including grants and infrastructure improvements.

Combating Corruption: Efforts to reduce small-scale corruption have shown some success, though concerns about accountability for senior officials in significant incidents (like the Karakalpakstan protests) persist.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Ongoing Human Rights Concerns: While reforms have led to some improvements, impunity for torture and ill-treatment remains a concern, and domestic violence is still prevalent. There have been no senior officials held accountable for excessive force during the July 2022 Karakalpakstan protests.

Restrictions on Civil Society and Expression: Freedom of expression, press, and assembly continue to be severely restricted. Authorities in 2024 increasingly targeted independent activists with unfounded criminal charges and blocked independent monitors' access. Journalists and bloggers face intimidation and state repression.

"Undesirable" Foreigners Law: A law passed in June 2024 (signed November 2024) allows authorities to designate foreigners or stateless people as "undesirable" if their speech or actions contradict state sovereignty or provoke various conflicts. This raises concerns about its use against human rights investigators and journalists.

Religious Restrictions: There are reports of increased restrictions and interrogations of observant Muslims in 2023-2024, and prison terms for sharing religious content online are more common.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Majority Muslim State: Islam is the predominant religion in Uzbekistan, largely Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school.

State Control over Religion: While freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed, the state maintains tight control over religious practices and institutions. There are concerns about increased restrictions on observant Muslims and stricter penalties for sharing religious content.

Secular Governance: The government promotes a secular approach to public life, and officials have reportedly been instructed to choose between government service and overt religious observance.

Gender Studies

Increased Female Representation in Parliament: The 2019 parliamentary elections saw an increase in women MPs, with a 40% gender quota for candidates (up from 30%), resulting in 57 women MPs in the new parliament (up from 47). This indicates progress in political representation.

Challenges: Despite progress in some areas, women continue to face societal challenges and issues, including domestic violence and potential discrimination.

Karakalpakstan: The autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan remains a sensitive area, particularly after the 2022 protests and the lack of accountability for the use of force.

Social Protection Reforms: The government is focused on improving health and social protection systems, including efforts to enhance access to clean drinking water (80% of population now has access) and expand pre-school education (60% of children now have access).

Forced Labor Eradication: Significant progress has been made in eradicating the systemic use of child and forced labor in the cotton harvest, leading to Uzbekistan's inclusion in the EU's GSP+ trade preferences system.
