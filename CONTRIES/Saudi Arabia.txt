Saudi Arabia
Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Absolute Monarchy: Saudi Arabia remains an absolute monarchy, where the King is both the head of state and government. King Salman is the reigning monarch, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) is widely regarded as the country's de facto ruler, consolidating significant political and economic power. The Basic Law of Government, adopted in 1992, states that the King must comply with Sharia (Islamic law) and the Qur'an. There are no political parties or national elections.



Vision 2030 and Strategic Leadership: The country's strategic leadership is overwhelmingly driven by Vision 2030, an ambitious government program launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2016. Its primary goal is to diversify the economy away from oil dependence, as well as achieve social and cultural transformation. By mid-2025, significant progress has been reported, with 85% of its 674 initiatives either completed or on track, and 93% of Vision Realization Program (VRP) and national strategy KPIs achieved or positively progressing. Key focus areas include increasing non-oil GDP, attracting foreign direct investment, and expanding the Public Investment Fund (PIF).


Foreign Policy: Saudi Arabia is actively pursuing a more independent and diversified foreign policy in 2025.

Regional De-escalation: The Kingdom continues efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, exemplified by its re-engagement with Iran and efforts to stabilize the situation in Yemen.

Global Partnerships: While maintaining strong ties with traditional allies like the US, Saudi Arabia is expanding its partnerships with countries in Asia (e.g., China, India) and Africa, reflecting a multi-polar foreign policy approach.

Economic Diplomacy: Foreign policy is heavily intertwined with economic objectives, seeking foreign investment for Vision 2030 projects and promoting Saudi Arabia as a global investment hub.

OPEC+ Influence: Saudi Arabia remains a key player within OPEC+, influencing global oil markets through production decisions, such as the extensions of OPEC+ production cuts.

Economic Outlook

Diversification and Growth: Saudi Arabia's economy is showing resilience and strong non-oil growth in 2025. The IMF forecasts overall GDP growth to accelerate to 3.5% in 2025, outpacing the global average. Non-oil real GDP is projected to grow by 3.4%, driven by private consumption and investment, particularly in retail, hospitality, and construction.


Vision 2030 Projects: Mega-projects under Vision 2030, such as NEOM, The Red Sea Project, and Diriyah, are significant drivers of non-oil economic activity and investment. The Public Investment Fund (PIF) plays a central role, with its assets under management significantly increasing since 2016, surpassing original 2030 targets.


Fiscal Position: The fiscal deficit is projected to widen to 4.3% of GDP in 2025, primarily due to increased government spending on Vision 2030 projects and lower oil revenues. The government plans to finance this deficit through borrowing, while aiming to maintain one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios globally (projected at 26.2% of GDP).

Inflation and Labor Market: Inflation remains contained, with a small pick-up to 2.3% in April 2025. The unemployment rate for Saudi nationals has reached a record low of 7% in 2024, surpassing the original Vision 2030 target. Female and youth unemployment have also significantly decreased.

Structural Reforms: Ongoing structural reforms aim to enhance the business environment, attract foreign investment, and increase the private sector's contribution to GDP. These include updates to investment and labor laws, and efforts to reduce energy subsidies.


Public Administration

Centralized Governance: Public administration is highly centralized, with decisions flowing from the top leadership.

Efficiency and Digitalization: Vision 2030 emphasizes improving government effectiveness, transparency, and efficiency, including a significant push for e-government services and digital transformation. Saudi Arabia's ranking in the UN E-Government Development Index has improved.


Public Investment Fund (PIF): The PIF is a powerful instrument of public administration, channeling vast resources into strategic projects to diversify the economy and create new sectors. Its governance and investment decisions are largely controlled by the Crown Prince.


Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Sharia Law as Primary Source: Islamic law (Sharia) is the primary source of legislation. Royal decrees form the basis of the country's legislation.

Human Rights Concerns (as of 2025 HRW Report):

Repression of Dissent: Authorities continue to harshly repress dissent, including peaceful online expression, leading to lengthy prison sentences and even death penalties after unfair trials.

Capital Punishment: Saudi Arabia continues to use the death penalty for a wide range of crimes, including non-lethal drug offenses. A UN expert in June 2025 urged Saudi Arabia to halt the imminent execution of 26 Egyptian nationals for drug-related offenses, citing violations of international law and fair trial guarantees. Since the beginning of 2025, 141 individuals have reportedly been executed, a majority for non-lethal drug offenses.


Arbitrary Detentions and Abuses: The 2017 "anti-corruption" crackdown involved arbitrary detentions and abusive treatment.

Forced Evictions: Human Rights Watch highlights forced evictions of residents, particularly from the Huwaitat community, for mega-projects like NEOM, with some individuals receiving severe sentences for protesting.

Women's Rights: While some reforms have occurred (e.g., lifting the driving ban), women still face discrimination in many aspects of life under the male guardianship system, effectively treating them as legal minors in some contexts.

LGBTQ+ Rights: Same-sex sexual relations remain illegal and punishable.

Freedom of Expression, Association, and Belief: These freedoms are severely restricted, with continuous crackdowns on peaceful social media activity.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Islam as State Religion: Islam is the official religion, and Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam, home to its holiest sites (Mecca and Medina).

Wahhabism: The country adheres to a conservative interpretation of Sunni Islam, often referred to as Wahhabism, which historically influenced the state's social and political control. However, the power of the religious establishment (ulama) has been significantly eroded under MBS, with a shift towards a more nationalistic and less outwardly conservative social policy in some areas.

Restrictions on Other Religions: Public practice of any religion other than Islam is prohibited.

Gender Studies

Increased Female Workforce Participation: A significant achievement under Vision 2030 is the near doubling of women's participation in the workforce, surpassing the 2030 target of 30% a decade early, with over 35% of women actively working. Women now own 45% of SMEs.

Remaining Challenges: Despite progress, women still face systemic discrimination under the male guardianship system in various aspects of life, including legal, social, and personal status matters. While public spaces are becoming less segregated, elements of "sex segregation" persist. Gender-based violence remains a concern.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Tribal Identity and Royal Family: Tribal identity remains strong and an important pillar of social control, alongside the ruling Al Saud family, whose governance often blends traditional tribal rule with modern state structures.

Cultural Modernization: Vision 2030 is driving significant social and cultural changes, including the development of entertainment, arts, and cultural events aimed at creating a "vibrant society" and enhancing quality of life. This includes large-scale projects like Qiddiya and Diriyah.


National Identity: Efforts are underway to foster a stronger national Saudi identity that transcends traditional tribal affiliations and embraces a modern, global outlook.

Challenges: The rapid pace of change brings social adjustments, and balancing modernization with cultural preservation is an ongoing dynamic.

Philosophy

Vision 2030 Philosophy: The overarching philosophy is rooted in Vision 2030's three pillars: "A Vibrant Society," "A Thriving Economy," and "An Ambitious Nation." It emphasizes economic diversification, improved quality of life, good governance, and Saudi Arabia's global positioning.

Agility and Adaptability: The scale and speed of reforms reflect a philosophy of agile governance and a willingness to rapidly adapt to global trends and economic necessities.

National Pride and Self-Reliance: A strong emphasis is placed on fostering national pride, self-reliance, and attracting global talent and investment while leveraging Saudi Arabia's unique cultural heritage and geopolitical position.

History

Unification of Saudi Arabia: Modern Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by Abdulaziz ibn Saud, unifying various tribal regions under the House of Saud, establishing a centralized state based on Wahhabist principles.

Oil Discovery: The discovery of vast oil reserves in the 1930s fundamentally transformed the country, leading to immense wealth and rapid development, shaping its geopolitical significance.

Post-Oil Era Preparation: The current era, particularly under MBS, marks a deliberate shift to prepare the country for a post-oil future, addressing the challenges of economic dependence on hydrocarbons and seeking sustainable growth.

Social Work

Welfare State: Saudi Arabia operates as a welfare state, providing a range of social services and benefits to its citizens, often through government programs. The Damaan social support program is well-targeted.


Focus Areas: Social work addresses issues related to family welfare, disability support, youth development, and providing assistance to vulnerable populations, including those impacted by rapid urban development projects (e.g., forced evictions in Jeddah and NEOM).

Government-Led Initiatives: Social welfare initiatives are primarily government-led, though non-profit organizations are encouraged under Vision 2030.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

State-Controlled Media: The media landscape is largely state-controlled or heavily influenced by the government. Critical reporting on the royal family or government policies is severely restricted.


Digital Transformation in Media: The government actively uses digital platforms for communication and public relations, promoting Vision 2030 achievements and managing its international image.

Social Media Scrutiny: While social media usage is high, individuals face severe penalties for critical online expression.

Education / Teaching

Human Capital Development: Vision 2030 places a strong emphasis on human capital development, aiming to reform the education system to meet the demands of a diversified, knowledge-based economy. This includes investing in vocational training and higher education.


Curriculum Modernization: Efforts are underway to modernize the curriculum, integrating critical thinking, technology, and skills relevant to future job markets.

Increased Female Enrollment: Women constitute a large percentage of university enrollees, though challenges remain in their full integration into certain parts of the workforce.

Library Science

Knowledge Hubs: Libraries are developing into modern knowledge hubs, supporting research, education, and cultural enrichment.

Digitalization and Accessibility: There's a push for digitizing resources and improving access to information, aligning with the broader digital transformation goals of Vision 2030.

Cultural Preservation: Libraries play a role in preserving Saudi Arabia's rich historical, Islamic, and cultural heritage.
