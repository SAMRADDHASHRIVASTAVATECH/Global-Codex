Political Science / IR / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies / Public Policy
Ruling Authority:
Military junta — National Rally and Development Committee (CNRD)
Headed by General Mamady Doumbouya since the Sept 2021 coup

Transition Timeline:

Constitutional referendum: Planned for September 21, 2025

Legislative & presidential elections: Scheduled for December 2025

Delays & backsliding raise doubts about commitment to transition

Democratic Concerns:

Dissolution of 107 political parties, suppression of opposition (e.g., RPG, UFDG)

General Doumbouya may run for president, despite initial pledges to abstain

Protest bans, arbitrary arrests, and human rights violations undermine credibility

Economic Outlook:

Strong projected GDP growth: 6.5% in 2025

Driven by mining sector, especially Simandou iron ore project (launch late 2025)

Simandou 2040 Plan: infrastructure, economic diversification, national development

Challenges:

High poverty (~52%), poor tax revenue (12.8% of GDP)

Weak non-mining job creation, fragile social safety nets

Crumbling trust between citizens and state institutions

International Affairs / Regional Diplomacy
ECOWAS Engagement:

Sanctions lifted, but transition monitoring continues

Guinea’s conduct is watched amidst regional trend of military takeovers (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger)

Great Power Influence:

Russia’s influence growing (e.g., mining interests, diplomacy)

Guinea risks being drawn into the Sahel's broader instability loop

Resource Diplomacy:

Guinea's vast bauxite, iron ore, and gold attract global attention (China, Russia, UAE, etc.)

Strategic role in global aluminum and iron markets

Public Administration
Governance Under Military Rule:

Centralized, opaque decision-making

Lack of democratic accountability, minimal public oversight

Despite anti-corruption rhetoric, lack of transparency continues

Concerns of elite capture of resource wealth

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies
Legal Framework:

Civil law system

Judiciary faces strong executive and military pressure

Key Concerns:

Pardon of Dadis Camara (2009 massacre conviction) undermines accountability

Systemic impunity, arbitrary arrests, and enforced disappearances persist

Economic Disparities:

Rural women face higher poverty, lower access to education and credit

Wartime Sexual Violence:

2009 massacre trial acknowledged rape and gender-based abuse — but pardons reverse justice gains

Anthropology / Sociology / Ethnic & Cultural Studies
Ethnic Landscape:

Major groups: Fulani (Peul), Malinké, Susu

Ethnic identities often politicized, particularly in elections

Mining & Society:

Rapid mine expansion → land expropriation, displacement, protests

Wealth gap between mining elites and local communities causes tension

Youth Disillusionment:

High unemployment, limited upward mobility

Youth-led protests and diaspora activism persist despite bans

Debate over whether Guinea’s mineral wealth should serve sovereignty or private enrichment

History
Pre-Colonial Legacy:

Part of Mali and Ghana empires

Rich Islamic and oral history traditions

Colonial Period:

French Guinea (colonized late 19th century)

Only French African colony to reject French community in 1958 → independence under Ahmed Sékou Touré

Post-Independence Rule:

One-party socialism under Touré (1958–1984)

Military coups and authoritarian rule dominated until Alpha Condé’s election (2010)

State controls traditional media; digital platforms heavily monitored

Independent Media at Risk:

Some journalists still operate underground or from exile

Fear of retaliation stifles watchdog reporting

Junta spreads propaganda and frames protests as foreign-influenced

Education / Teaching
Underinvestment:

Poor infrastructure, low teacher pay, resource shortages

Access in rural regions severely limited

Disruption by Instability:

Security Sector Abuses:

Armed forces accused of extrajudicial killings, torture, and repression of civilians
