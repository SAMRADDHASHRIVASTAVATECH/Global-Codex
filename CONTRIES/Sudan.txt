Intensifying Civil War and Political Fragmentation: As of July 2025, Sudan is in the grips of an intensifying civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti). The conflict, which erupted in April 2023, shows no signs of abating, with both parties "unrelenting" in their military objectives. The fighting has shifted focus to the Darfur and Kordofan regions, with El Obeid becoming a key flashpoint. Both sides are accused of indiscriminate aerial assaults, use of heavy weaponry in populated areas, and continuous attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure.



Competing Governments and Lack of Central Authority: The political landscape is fragmented. Prime Minister Kamil Eltayeb Idris was appointed by al-Burhan in May 2025 and is attempting to form a new "Government of Hope." However, divisions persist within the "Tassis alliance" led by the RSF over the composition of a planned "parallel government" in areas under their control. This indicates a severe lack of unified central governance.



Failed Peace Initiatives and Regional Instability: Multiple mediation efforts by regional and international bodies (UN, AU, EU, IGAD, League of Arab States) have largely failed to achieve a lasting ceasefire or political resolution. The conflict has far-reaching consequences, extending beyond Sudan's borders, with reports of clashes at the tri-border zone of Sudan, Libya, and Egypt. The international community is urging de-escalation and concerted action to end the "senseless suffering."


Strategic Leadership Vacuum: There is a critical vacuum in strategic leadership capable of unifying the country and charting a path towards peace and a civilian-led transition. The focus remains on military objectives rather than inclusive political dialogue.

Foreign Policy and External Interference: Sudan's foreign relations are deeply impacted by the ongoing conflict, with various international and regional actors providing diplomatic and military support to opposing sides.

External Support: Saudi Arabia and Egypt reportedly back the SAF, while the UAE is alleged to support the RSF. Ethiopia and Eritrea are also cited as supporting the paramilitary group and the army, respectively. Chad has been accused of facilitating arms shipments to the RSF. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Iran have also been linked to diplomatic and military support to the SAF.


International Conferences: High-level international conferences (e.g., London Sudan Conference in April 2025, EU-hosted Consultative Meetings) are taking place to coordinate humanitarian response and promote a negotiated settlement, but concerns about unilateral government formations persist.

ICC Cooperation: The UN Security Council is monitoring the ICC's efforts to ensure accountability for crimes in Darfur, with the ICC Prosecutor having gathered sufficient evidence for new arrest warrants related to the current conflict.

Economic Outlook

Deep Crisis and Hyperinflation: Sudan's economy is in a catastrophic state in July 2025 due to the prolonged civil war. Real GDP growth for 2025 is projected to be negative (-0.4% by IMF), following a severe contraction. Hyperinflation is rampant, with an average consumer price inflation rate projected at 100% for 2025, reaching 75.6% by year-end.

Massive Unemployment and Poverty: The conflict has devastated livelihoods, leading to an alarmingly high unemployment rate, projected at 62% for 2025. Poverty is widespread, exacerbated by the destruction of infrastructure and the disruption of economic activity.


Fiscal Collapse: The government's financial situation is dire, with a projected general government gross debt of 252% of GDP in 2025. Revenue collection has collapsed due to the conflict, and essential services are severely underfunded.

Humanitarian Catastrophe Impact: The economic collapse is intrinsically linked to the humanitarian catastrophe, with critical infrastructure like markets, health systems, and water sources destroyed or non-functional. Both warring parties are reportedly using starvation as a weapon of war by obstructing aid.

Public Administration

Collapse of State Institutions: Public administration has largely collapsed outside of areas firmly controlled by either the SAF or the RSF. Essential government services are non-existent or severely disrupted in vast parts of the country.

Decentralized Control and Parallel Structures: Where there is any semblance of administration, it is often localized and under the control of the respective warring faction. The RSF's efforts to form a "parallel government" highlight the complete breakdown of unified state structures.

Lack of Rule of Law: The absence of effective public administration contributes directly to the breakdown of the rule of law and the perpetuation of human rights abuses.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Systemic Breakdown: Sudan's criminal justice system has largely collapsed due to the civil war. There is widespread impunity for crimes committed by both warring parties.

Grave Human Rights and Protection Emergency: The situation is described as a "grave human rights and protection emergency." Both the SAF and RSF are committing serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.


Targeted Killings and Ethnic Violence: Reports indicate summary executions, particularly by the SAF and allies, against those suspected of supporting the RSF, sometimes based on ethnic identity. The RSF and allied Arab militias are conducting ethnically motivated attacks against groups like the Zaghawa, Masalit, and Fur, especially in Darfur and Kordofan.

Conflict-Related Sexual Violence (CRSV): There is a sharp rise in sexual and gender-based violence, with women and girls subjected to rape, gang rape, abduction, sexual slavery, and forced marriage, particularly in RSF-controlled displacement camps.

Attacks on Civilians and Infrastructure: Increased use of heavy weaponry in populated areas, attacks on hospitals and medical facilities, and destruction and looting of villages (e.g., by the RSF in El Fasher) are rampant.

Obstruction of Aid: Both sides are obstructing humanitarian aid, with the SAF imposing bureaucratic restrictions and the RSF looting convoys and blocking aid entirely, contributing to widespread famine.

Impunity: The failure to ensure accountability for past and ongoing atrocities remains a major concern, contributing to the recurrence of violence. The ICC Prosecutor is pursuing investigations, but challenges remain in cooperation and evidence collection.

Arbitrary Arrests and Torture: Human rights defenders, medical workers, and aid personnel perceived to have supported the RSF have faced arbitrary arrest, torture, and in some cases, execution in areas recaptured by the SAF.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Predominantly Muslim (Sunni) with Christian Minority: Sudan is predominantly a Sunni Muslim country, with a significant Christian minority, particularly in the south.

Role of Religion in Conflict: While the current conflict is primarily a power struggle between military factions, historical and social tensions, including those with religious undertones, can be exploited. Religious leaders often play a role in advocating for peace and humanitarian aid, though their influence is often limited in the face of widespread violence.

Gender Studies

Disproportionate Impact on Women and Girls: Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the conflict, facing a sharp rise in sexual and gender-based violence, including rape, gang rape, abduction, sexual slavery, and forced marriage.

Specific Vulnerabilities in Displacement: The situation in displacement camps, particularly those under RSF control, highlights extreme vulnerability to CRSV.

Lack of Protection and Accountability: The breakdown of the justice system means there is little to no protection or accountability for perpetrators of GBV, perpetuating a cycle of violence.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Deeply Divided Society: Sudan is a multi-ethnic and culturally diverse country, but it is deeply divided by long-standing ethnic, political, and economic tensions, which are being exacerbated and exploited by the current conflict.

Mass Displacement and Social Fabric Destruction: The war has led to one of the worst displacement crises globally, with over 14 million people displaced (over 3 million fleeing to neighboring countries). This has shattered communities, disrupted social networks, and destroyed cultural heritage.

Targeted Ethnic Attacks: The ongoing ethnically motivated attacks, particularly in Darfur and Kordofan, against groups like the Masalit, Zaghawa, and Fur, underscore the severe breakdown of inter-communal relations and the risk of further atrocity crimes.

Urban Devastation: Major cities, especially Khartoum, have been reduced to "burnt-out shells," indicating the massive destruction of urban social infrastructure.

Philosophy

State Failure and the Pursuit of Peace: The philosophical core of the crisis revolves around the failure of the state to protect its citizens and provide basic security. The ongoing conflict poses fundamental questions about national sovereignty, the responsibility to protect, and the possibility of achieving a just and lasting peace in the face of such devastation.

Justice vs. Impunity: A crucial philosophical and practical challenge is how to ensure justice and accountability for perpetrators of atrocities, particularly given the long history of impunity for crimes committed in Darfur and the current widespread violations. The international community is grappling with how to break this "cycle of impunity."

Humanitarianism and Intervention: The scale of the humanitarian crisis raises ethical dilemmas for the international community regarding the limits of humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to act.

History

Long History of Conflict: Sudan has a long history of internal conflicts, often rooted in ethnic, religious, and resource-based tensions.

Independence (1956): Gained independence from Anglo-Egyptian rule in 1956.

Civil Wars: Experienced two prolonged civil wars (1955-1972 and 1983-2005) between the North and South, largely over resource control, identity, and governance, which eventually led to the secession of South Sudan in 2011.

Darfur Conflict (2003 onwards): A brutal conflict erupted in Darfur in 2003, characterized by widespread human rights abuses and allegations of genocide.

Overthrow of Bashir (2019): A popular uprising led to the overthrow of long-time dictator Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, sparking hopes for a democratic transition.

Military Coup (2021): The transitional government was overthrown by a military coup in October 2021, reversing democratic gains.

Current Civil War (2023-Present): The current conflict between the SAF and RSF, which began in April 2023, represents a catastrophic escalation of tensions that emerged after the coup, pushing the country into an unprecedented humanitarian disaster.

Social Work

Massive Humanitarian Response: Social workers are at the forefront of responding to the world's largest humanitarian and displacement crisis. This includes providing emergency relief, psychosocial support to traumatized populations (especially women and children), and assistance to IDPs and refugees.

Child Protection: Addressing child recruitment by armed groups, high rates of child malnutrition, and the severe impact of violence on children's well-being are critical.

GBV Support: Providing support and safe spaces for survivors of widespread sexual and gender-based violence is a monumental task.

Community Support: Social workers play a role in attempting to rebuild shattered communities, facilitating local peace initiatives where possible, and supporting resilience in the face of ongoing trauma and displacement.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Extremely Dangerous Environment: Sudan is one of the most dangerous and restricted environments for journalists. Media freedom is severely curtailed, with journalists facing intimidation, arbitrary arrests, and violence.


Telecommunications Blackout: A near-total telecommunications blackout in early 2025 severely restricted the right to freedom of expression and hampered coordination of humanitarian assistance. The RSF reportedly gained control of internet service providers' data centers in Khartoum, exacerbating the issue.

Disinformation and Propaganda: Both warring parties use propaganda, making it difficult for citizens and the international community to access accurate and unbiased information about the conflict.

Education / Teaching

Widespread Disruption: The civil war has caused a near-total collapse of the education system in many parts of Sudan. Schools have been destroyed, occupied, or are unsafe to attend.


Displacement Impact: Millions of displaced children are out of school, facing significant barriers to accessing any form of education.

Teacher Shortages: The displacement and death of teachers, coupled with a lack of resources, have led to severe teacher shortages.

Lost Generation: The prolonged conflict risks creating a lost generation with limited access to education, severely impacting Sudan's future human capital development.

Library Science

Risk to Cultural Heritage: The ongoing conflict poses an immense threat to Sudan's rich cultural heritage, including its historical documents, archives, and libraries, which are at risk of destruction, looting, and neglect.

Loss of Access to Information: The destruction of libraries and the general collapse of infrastructure severely limit access to information and educational resources for the population.

Preservation Efforts (Limited): While international bodies may express concern, on-the-ground efforts to preserve library collections and historical records are extremely challenging due to the pervasive insecurity and lack of resources.

Role in Future Recovery: In any post-conflict scenario, libraries would be crucial for rebuilding knowledge infrastructure, supporting education, and fostering a sense of shared cultural identity. However, this remains a distant prospect in July 2025.
