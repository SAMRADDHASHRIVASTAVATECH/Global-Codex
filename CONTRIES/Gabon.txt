📘 Political Science / IR / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies
2023 Military Coup: Ali Bongo Ondimba was ousted in August 2023 by General Brice Oligui Nguema after widely contested elections.

New Constitution (2024): Introduced two-term limits, direct universal suffrage, and candidate age limits (excludes key opposition figures); seen as both a reform and consolidation of power.

Democracy Concerns: High turnout (~70%), improved media freedom, but critics cite military orchestration, opposition marginalization, and hyper-presidentialism.

Anti-Corruption Drive: Mass arrests of former Bongo allies signal change—but transparency and due process remain critical.

Governance Reform: New constitution favors strong executive; risks hyper-centralization despite procedural reforms.
