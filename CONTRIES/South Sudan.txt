Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Fragile Political Landscape and Peace Agreement Implementation: As of July 2025, South Sudan's political landscape remains extremely fragile and is characterized by a deepening crisis in the implementation of the 2018 Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS). Tensions are high due to the breakdown of relations within the presidency, with the arrest of First Vice President Riek Machar in March 2025 and numerous senior SPLM/A-IO officials. This has been widely denounced as marking the collapse of the peace agreement by Machar's party.


Postponed Elections and Constitutional Process: The general elections, initially set for December 2024, have been postponed, with a new timeline extending the transitional period until February 2027. This postponement, while endorsed by the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC), is viewed with concern by international partners as it risks exacerbating the human rights crisis if leaders do not change course. The constitutional review process is underway but faces significant challenges.

Escalating Violence: Violence against civilians is escalating to record levels, with 1,607 victims (739 killed, 679 injured) reported in the first quarter of 2025 â€“ the highest number in any three-month period since 2020. Most victims are attributed to community-based militias (66%), but conventional parties to the armed conflict are also increasingly responsible. Warrap State and Central Equatoria have recorded the highest number of civilian casualties.

Strategic Leadership and Peacebuilding: Despite the turmoil, there are ongoing efforts by international and regional partners, including the UN, AU, and IGAD, to mediate and keep the peace process on track. Initiatives like the Tumaini talks (though facing setbacks) aim to reboot the peace deal. There is a strong focus on reconciliation, stabilization, and resilience (RSR) efforts, promoting integrated programming across humanitarian, development, and peacebuilding activities, often with a local focus.

Foreign Policy:

International Engagement: South Sudan continues to be a major recipient of international humanitarian and development assistance, with UNHCR and UNICEF playing significant roles. The UNMISS mandate was extended until April 2026, and several countries, including Japan, contribute personnel to support peace and security.


Regional Relations: The conflict in Sudan continues to have a profound impact on South Sudan, including the influx of over 1 million people (returnees and Sudanese refugees) and disruptions to oil revenues. Relations with Sudan remain critical given the shared oil infrastructure.

Sanctions Regime: The UN Security Council extended sanctions on South Sudan (asset freezes, travel bans, and an arms embargo) until May 2026. While some members (including African states) argue that sanctions hinder the government's ability to build security institutions, others stress their necessity due to escalating violence and lack of progress on peace benchmarks.

Economic Outlook

Deep Contraction and Hyperinflation: South Sudan is in the throes of a severe economic crisis in 2025. The World Bank projects its GDP to contract by a staggering 30% in FY24/25, primarily due to the disruption of oil production caused by the conflict in Sudan, which cut off a major source of revenue. This comes on top of five consecutive years of economic decline. GDP per capita is estimated to fall to half of FY20 levels.



Oil Dependence and Fiscal Strain: The economy remains acutely vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on oil, which accounts for the bulk of national income. The disruption of oil exports has severely strained public finances, leading to significant salary arrears for government employees and reduced spending on essential services like health and education.

Poverty and Food Insecurity: Poverty has risen to an estimated 92% of the population. Hyperinflation (estimated above 60% in early 2025) and widespread food insecurity affect nearly 80% of the population, with 4.6 million people projected to face crisis-level hunger (IPC Phase 3 or worse) in 2025. Acute malnutrition affects 1.8 million children.


Call for Reforms: The World Bank urges swift and sustained reforms, including strengthening the macroeconomic framework, increasing exchange rate flexibility, curtailing monetary financing of the deficit, improving oil revenue management and transparency, and boosting non-oil revenues. Diversifying the revenue base and reducing import dependency are also highlighted as crucial for long-term stability and self-reliance.


Public Administration

Weak Governance and Fiscal Management: Weak governance, poor management of oil revenues, and ineffective fiscal policies continue to plague public administration. The government's inability to pay salaries on time has further undermined its capacity.


Constitutional Review Challenges: The National Constitutional Review Commission is assessing its preparedness, but the overall process faces significant political obstacles and concerns about inclusivity.

Capacity Building: International partners like India continue to offer capacity-building programs through initiatives like the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) program.

Criminal Justice / Legal Studies

Common Law System: South Sudan's legal system is based on English common law.

Justice Sector Challenges: The justice sector faces immense challenges related to capacity, efficiency, and access to justice. The government has not reviewed its outdated penal code or established a national human rights commission.

Human Rights Crisis (as of July 2025): The human rights situation is dire.

Escalating Violence: Violence against civilians is at record levels, with high numbers of killings, injuries, abductions, and conflict-related sexual violence.

Perpetrators: Community-based militias are the primary perpetrators, but conventional armed groups are also increasingly responsible for violations.

Civilian Protection: Attacks on civilians, including aerial bombardments of civilian areas and medical facilities, continue.

Freedom of Expression: The space for freedom of expression is severely restricted, with journalists facing intimidation, arbitrary arrests, and detention. Social media was temporarily blocked in January 2025.


Displacement: Conflict and climate-related shocks continue to cause massive internal displacement, with humanitarian agencies facing severe challenges in delivering aid due to insecurity.

Inter-Communal Violence: Escalating inter-communal conflict, often driven by competition over scarce resources exacerbated by climate change, leads to civilian deaths, injuries, and displacement.

Death Penalty: The death penalty is still used, with military courts sentencing people to death, including individuals who were children at the time of their alleged offenses.

Divinity / Theology / Religious Studies

Predominantly Christian: Christianity is the dominant religion in South Sudan, with a variety of denominations.

Role of Churches: Churches often play a significant role in community life, social services, and peacebuilding efforts at the local level.

Gender Studies

Disproportionate Impact of Violence: Women and girls are disproportionately affected by conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) and other forms of gender-based violence (GBV), accounting for 98% of documented victims of CRSV.

Lack of Legal Protection: South Sudan has not ratified key international conventions on women's rights like CEDAW or the Maputo Protocol, hindering legal protections against sexual violence and other abuses.

Empowerment Efforts: Despite the challenges, initiatives are underway to include gender equality and the empowerment of women and youth in peacebuilding and conflict resolution efforts, including training for women in uniform to combat GBV.

Anthropology / Sociology / Cultural Studies / Indigenous Studies / Ethnic Studies

Multi-Ethnic Society: South Sudan is a multi-ethnic country with numerous distinct ethnic groups, primarily Nilotic, each with its own cultural practices and languages.

Clan and Community Structures: Clan and community structures play a significant role in social organization, and inter-communal violence remains a major challenge, often driven by competition for resources, cattle rustling, and unresolved grievances.

Forced Displacement and Livelihood Erosion: Conflict, insecurity, and climate shocks have led to massive displacement and the erosion of traditional coping mechanisms and livelihoods, pushing communities into deeper vulnerability.

Erosion of Traditional Livelihoods: The compounding effects of conflict and flooding have led to a decline in traditional livestock and crop farming, forcing people to rely on humanitarian aid and alternative, often unsustainable, livelihood strategies.

Philosophy

State Building Amidst Fragility: The overarching philosophical challenge is state-building in an environment of extreme fragility, seeking to establish legitimate and effective governance structures while addressing deep-seated conflict drivers.

Peace and Reconciliation: A central philosophical tenet is the pursuit of peace and reconciliation, often through locally led initiatives and the complex implementation of the R-ARCSS.

Self-Reliance vs. Aid Dependence: There is a growing recognition of the need for South Sudan to move towards greater economic self-reliance, charting a national economic vision that gradually reduces its heavy reliance on foreign aid and donor-driven agendas, as discussed at forums like SPIEF 2025.

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus: International and local actors increasingly adopt a "Triple Nexus" approach, recognizing the interconnectedness of humanitarian, development, and peacebuilding efforts.

History

Part of Sudan: Historically, South Sudan was part of Sudan and experienced decades of civil wars against the North.

Comprehensive Peace Agreement (2005): A landmark peace agreement in 2005 ended the second civil war and paved the way for a referendum on independence.

Independence (2011): South Sudan gained independence in July 2011, becoming the world's newest nation.

Civil War (2013-2018): Just two years after independence, a brutal civil war erupted in 2013 between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and his former Vice President Riek Machar, leading to widespread atrocities and a severe humanitarian crisis.

Revitalized Peace Agreement (2018): An agreement signed in 2018 brought a fragile peace, leading to the formation of a unity government, but its implementation remains deeply troubled as of 2025.

Social Work

Humanitarian Response: Social workers are critical in responding to the severe humanitarian crisis, including supporting internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, and returnees, and addressing widespread food insecurity and malnutrition.

Child Protection: Addressing child protection concerns, including the high rates of child victims of violence, child marriage, and the impact of conflict on children's well-being, is a major focus.

Gender-Based Violence Support: Providing vital support, counseling, and safe spaces for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence is a crucial area of intervention.

Peacebuilding and Reconciliation: Social workers contribute to community-based peacebuilding and reconciliation initiatives, helping to heal social divisions and address trauma from prolonged conflict.

Journalism / Communication / Media / PR / Digital Media

Extremely Restricted Environment: South Sudan is one of the most dangerous and restricted environments for journalists. Media freedom is severely curtailed, with journalists facing intimidation, arrest, detention, and violence.

Censorship: The government has previously imposed social media blocks and curfews, highlighting a lack of respect for freedom of expression.

Disinformation: The conflict and political instability are often accompanied by misinformation and propaganda, making independent and reliable journalism even more vital but also more challenging.

Education / Teaching

Limited Access and Quality: Access to quality education remains extremely limited, particularly in rural and conflict-affected areas. Many schools lack adequate infrastructure, materials, and qualified teachers.


Out-of-School Children: A significant proportion of children are out of school, exacerbated by conflict, displacement, and poverty. UNICEF prioritizes reaching out-of-school children with alternative education methods.


Impact of Conflict: Conflict frequently disrupts education, with schools being damaged, occupied by armed groups, or used as shelters for displaced populations.

Human Capital Development: Despite the challenges, human capital development through education is recognized as essential for long-term peace and economic recovery.

Library Science

Preservation of Knowledge: Libraries play a crucial role in preserving South Sudan's diverse cultural heritage and traditional knowledge, which are at risk due to conflict and displacement.

Access to Information: They are vital for providing access to educational resources and supporting literacy efforts in a country with significant educational challenges.

Community Hubs: Where they exist, libraries can serve as important community hubs, supporting learning, peacebuilding, and cultural exchange. However, their development and accessibility are severely hampered by ongoing instability and limited resources.
