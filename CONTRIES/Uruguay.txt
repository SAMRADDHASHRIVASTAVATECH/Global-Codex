Political Science / International Relations / Public Policy / Strategic Leadership / Development Studies

Stable Democracy: Uruguay continues its tradition of democratic stability. The center-left Broad Front coalition assumed power in March 2025, with President Yamandú Orsi. Recent departmental and municipal elections on May 11, 2025, largely affirmed existing political alignments.

Government Priorities: The Orsi administration's core agenda focuses on economic growth, equity, and citizen security. It aims to balance macroeconomic stability with addressing low growth, inequality, and improving public health.

Foreign Policy: Uruguay actively participates in regional integration through MERCOSUR and maintains robust bilateral ties, including ongoing cooperation with the US on drug trafficking and border security. Uruguay remains a significant contributor to UN peacekeeping missions.

Fiscal Rule and Public Accounts: The government faces challenges in managing public finances, with fiscal consolidation efforts having stalled in 2024.

Regulatory Reforms: A key policy initiative is the creation of Uruguay's first independent health regulatory agency, the Agency for the Evaluation, Regulation and Surveillance of Health Technologies (AUVISA), to modernize healthcare and streamline drug approvals.

Economic Outlook

Moderate Growth (July 2025): Uruguay's economy is projected to grow moderately, with GDP growth expected around 2.1% to 2.8% in 2025. This follows a 3.1% rebound in 2024, driven by agricultural recovery and increased tourism.

Key Economic Drivers and Challenges: Exports, particularly pulp, are a major driver. However, slowed household consumption and a lack of new large investments are moderating factors. Global uncertainty and the US's new 10% tariff on imports from April 2025 are noted headwinds.

Inflation and Monetary Policy: Inflation is projected to reach 5.4% in 2025, remaining above the Central Bank's 4.5% target, suggesting a continued restrictive monetary policy.

Fiscal Challenges: Pension-related expenditures pose a significant fiscal challenge, limiting the government's financial flexibility.

Key Sectors: Agriculture (beef, soybeans, cellulose, rice), food processing, software, tourism, and banking services remain vital to the economy.

Public Administration

Government Priorities: Public administration is aligned with the new government's focus on economic growth, equity, and citizen security.

Health Regulatory Agency: A significant effort is underway to establish AUVISA, an independent health regulatory agency, to modernize the healthcare system and improve drug approval processes.
