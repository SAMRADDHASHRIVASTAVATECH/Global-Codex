Economic Outlook
Boom–Bust Cycle:

Mining-led surge in 2023–2024 (7.2% growth in 2023).

Projected slowdown in 2025 (0.6%–6.3%, depending on source), due to:

Coal price decline

Political instability

Weakened exports

Mining Dominance:

Economy is overexposed to commodities like coal, copper (Oyu Tolgoi).

2024 coal exports = >40% of government revenue. Prices now falling.

Inflation & Fiscal Stress:

Inflation: ~9.1% (ADB) → driven by tariffs and expansionary policy

Public debt: 64.5% of GDP, moderated but risky

Spending surge in 2023–24 → now facing austerity pressure

Diversification Push:

EAEU pact aims to grow meat, cashmere, leather exports

Investment in copper processing, coke chemicals

Ambitious but long-term, threatened by instability

Public Administration
Corruption Crisis:

National programs (2023–24) and Criminal Code amendments exist

But enforcement weak; judiciary lacks independence

Protests show public frustration with anti-graft failures

Judicial Reform:

2024 judicial law → digitalization of courts, more budget

Still issues with case backlog and fair trial delays

Child Protection:

Revised law (2024) + increased budget → more shelters, interview rooms

Still lacks social workers and long-term family support networks

Disaster Risk:

Frequent dzuds, desertification, and air pollution

Government focusing on risk management and climate resilience

Nomadic Culture:

Still core identity, but under stress from climate, urban drift, poverty

Ger districts in Ulaanbaatar = urban migration pressure cooker
